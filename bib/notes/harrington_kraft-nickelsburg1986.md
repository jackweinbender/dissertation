Harrington adopts the term "rewritten bible" 

>   "simply to refer to those products of Palestinian Judaism at the turn of the era that take as their literary framework the flow of the biblical text itself and apparently have as their major purpose the clarification and actualization of the biblical story [@239].

He constructs a slightly expanded list of texts, including:

* Jubilees
* Assumption of Moses
* 11QTemple (Temple Scroll)
* GenApoc
* Ps. Philo's *Biblical Antiquities*
* Josephus's *Jewish Antiquities*

He also makes a point to suggest that a number of other texts may be able to be included in the list, including *Paraleipomena of Jeremiah*, *Life of Adam and Eve/Apocalypse of Moses*, and *Ascension of Isaiah*. He also includes the novel criterion that the works should derive from Palestinian Judaism, although he concedes that this is artificial. As an aside, he notes that this distinction is rooted in Cross' local text hypothesis. Since this is no longer *au courant*, it's probably not worth perusing. He does, however, make a very nice observation which will bolster my basic thesis, stating:

>   "What holds all of them [RwB texts] together is the effort to actualize a religious tradition and make it meaningful within new situations" [@239-40]

Harrington's major break from Vermes comes in his rejection of RwB as a category or literary genre in favor of a process-oriented approach. He states:

>   Nevertheless, establishing that these books are not appropriately described as targums or midrashim is not the same as proving that they all represent a distinctive literary genre called "rewritten Bible." In fact, it seems better to view rewriting the Bible as a kind of activity or process than to see it as a distinctive literary genre of Palestinian Judaism" [@242--243]

In this respect, Harrington takes a broad view of rewriting and allows, to some degree, that this process be understood similar to a reception history (although, this is my term, and not his). Instead, he observes that while texts such as Jubilees and *Assumption of Moses* both constitute a rewriting of the Bible, both "are formally revelations of apocalypses" [@243]. In other words, a single *genre*---insofar as the word describes a literary *form*---is not sufficient to subsume the varied *forms* (read: apocalypse, history, testament, etc.) which all can be described as "rewritten."

Harrington suggests that the intention of each work ought to be evaluated independently.
