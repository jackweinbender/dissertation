# Once More, with Feeling: Rewritten Scripture in Ancient Judaism---a Review of Recent Developments

## Daniel Machiela (2010)

Daniel Machiela's article gives a brief review of three recent mongraphs that came out in the early 2000's and offers a number of very useful observations about the state of the question. He groups scholars broadly into two categories: 'minimalists,' those who seek to restrict the use of the term RwB to a relatively small number of texts which exhibit a particular set of characteristics or operate with a "loosely defined methodology by which the base text is returned to over and over again," and not distinguishing between the "text" and the "interpretation" of the text (i.e. the interpretation is woven into the narrative) [@machiela_jss2010, 309].

Machiela offers a number of good observations about the three books under review, but the main contributions that his article makes are the numerous and insightful---if generally brief---comments that he makes about the broader conversation, of which the three books are a part. 

#### On "Spectrums"

Machiela critiques Crawford and others for characterizing rewritten biblical texts as falling on a spectrum which measures how closely a rewritten text follows its *Vorlage*. The problem with this characterization, according to Machiela, is that "any spectrum or sliding scale is by nature extremely restrictive, and we must be careful to explicate what feature(s) we are measuring" [@312--13]. Restricting our analysis only to how closely a text resembles its *Vorlage* only measures a single dimension of texts which show a remarkable diversity in any number of other attributes. Thus, Machiela suggests that should we use the idea of a "spectrum," we should not restrict ourselves to a single dimension; other attributes such as "the level of apocalyptic or Hellenistic influence" a text may exhibit [@313] and later "'popular' to 'scholastic'" [@314].

#### On Genre

Machiela also seems to have been the first major voice to address the fact that while a number of scholars had been evoking the term "genre" when talking about RwB, few, if any, had spent any time engaging with recent literature on modern genre theory. Machiela notes in a lengthy parenthetical:

>   It may be that the Russian Formalists or French Structuralists have little or nothing to add to our present discussion ... but we may do well to pursue such matters further and see what sort of cross-fertilisation occurs. At the very least it seems this field must be consulted in order to rule out the possibility of rewritten Bible/Scripture as a genre. [@314]

#### Conclusions

Machiela affirms a number of important points about the term RwB. First, he makes it a point to emphasize that we are not speaking only about an abstract idea, but about particular texts which, at the outset of the conversation, lacked a meaningful descriptor. Second, RwB is a modern category. This is a point which, I feel, gets lost too often. VanderKam and others' attempt to rectify the "anachronism" of the term "Bible," I think, has obscured this fact by bringing the author's understanding of his base text to the fore.  Third, he agrees with Brooke and Falk that "genre" is not the appropriate descriptor of the term, and instead, the therm should focus on RwB as representing "an exegetical process or activity relative to an authoritative base text" [@318]. Fourth, while he does not include works such as 1 Enoch among the RwB texts, he makes the observation that certain portions of, for example, the Animal Apocalypse, could be considered a "rewriting" of portions of Genesis. This is reflective of his preference toward *process* over formal attributes (cf. Segal who uses as one of his criteria the scope of the work, which categorically excludes the possibility of considering *portions* of texts).

Machiela, ultimately, places himself within the "minimalists" camp, although, unlike Segal and Bernstien, he views RwB as a process, rather than a category.
