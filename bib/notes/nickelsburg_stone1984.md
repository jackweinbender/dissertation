# The Bible Rewritten and Expanded

## George Nickelsburg (1986)

### Intro

Nickelsburg discusses literatures which "is very closely related to the biblical texts, expanding and paraphrasing them and implicitly commenting on them" [@89]. He suggests the the preoccupation with this particular set of texts (i.e., what would later become the bible) reflects the growing acceptance of these texts as "canon," or something similar.

Nickelsburg's article involves more than just "rewritten" texts (as the title indicates), also discussing texts which introduce wholly new material into the texts [@89--90].

#### Rewritten Texts: 

*   1 Enoch
*   Book of Giants
*   Jubilees
*   Genesis Apocryphon
*   Biblical Antiquities
*   Books of Adam and Eve (Apocalypse of Moses, Life of Adam and Eve)
*   Hellenistic Jewish Poets

The inclusion of 1 Enoch is novel, compared to Vermes's original list, and illustrates the more expansive view that Nickelsburg has toward RwB. Furthermore, Nickelsburg also includes in his discussion a few works by hellenistic Jewish poets. These works include Philo's *On Jerusalem*, Theodotus's *On the Jews*, and the *Exagoge* by one "Ezekiel the Poet of Tragedies."

Nickelsburg traces a trajectory from smaller units of rewriting---involving short stories that deal with particular events from the biblical text---to longer, more systematic, treatments which span multiple biblical books. His treatment of 1 Enoch (which is, at least in part, the earliest text that he deals with) is illustrative of this schema. Rather than dealing with 1 Enoch as a whole, Nickelsburg addresses separately 1 Enoch 6--11, 12--16, 106--107, 65--67 and 83--84 (together), and the Book of Giants (which is not formally a part of 1 Enoch, but has a clear connection to the work). Notably, the interaction of 1 Enoch with the biblical text revolves around a single event, namely the flood and its causes (which are not identical with the biblical account). The book of Jubilees, on the other hand, covers Gen 1--Exod 14, while *LAB* covers Gen--1 Samuel (until the death of Saul), albeit with major omissions.

Because Nickelsburg does not treat these texts as a unified category of texts, he goes out of his way to investigate the purpose of each text in its historical context. While this is not unique to Nickelsburg, it serves to illustrate the benefit of *not* treating these texts as a generic unity; clearly each text had its own ends in mind when its author wrote it. 

Furthermore, the posture toward and implicit role of the biblical text is also not uniform among even the agreed upon RwB texts. Nickelsburg notes that, for example, where Jubilees's concerns are largely halakhic and makes explicit reference to the biblical text, the authority assumed by the author of Jubilees does not (at least rhetorically) originate in the exposition of the Torah, but in the "immutable heavenly tablets" [@100--101]. Nickelsburg thus states:

>   "This process of transmitting and revising the biblical text reflects a remarkable view of Scripture and tradition. The pseudepigraphic ascription of the book to an angel of the presence and the attribution of laws to the heavenly tablets invest the author's interpretation of Scripture with absolute divine authority" [@101].

Nickelsburg contrasts this notion of a written "second Torah" with the mishnaic notion of an oral transmission of special revelation from Sinai [@101].

In contrast, the Genesis Apocryphon seems to have very little interest in halakhic matters. Nickelsburg writes:

>   "Different from *Jubilees* and the *Testaments*, the extant sections indicate little interest in halakhic matters or moral exhortation. Considerable notice is given to geographical details, and there is come emphasis on prayer. The author's treatment of his characters is marked by a sensitivity to the emotions and reactions that reflect their humanity" [@106]

Finally, he observes that *LAB* likewise differs with Jubilees in its omission of halakhic matters and its "highly selective reproduction of the text" [@110]. This selectivity also differs from the Genesis Apocryphon, which otherwise is "characterized by the addition of lengthy non-biblical incidence" [@110].
