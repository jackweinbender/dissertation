Alexander's goal is to examine the use of the biblical text within the so-called RwB texts to determine whether they form a distinct genre and whether there exists a set of concrete criteria by which scholars can admit or exclude texts from the category [@99].

>   "We shall focus attention on four works normally included in the genre (Jubilees, Genesis Apocryphon, the *Liber Antiquitatum Biblicarum*, and Josephus' *Jewish Antiquities*), and analyse these with respect to their form, their attitude towards the authority of the Bible, their use of biblical and non-biblical material, and their exegetical methods." [@99--100]

Through a series of four case studies (Jubilees, Genesis Apocryphon, *Liber Antiquitatum Biblicarum*, and Josephus's *Jewish Antiquities*) Alexander determines that does form a distinct literary genre and sets out nine "principal characteristics" of RwB:

1.  They are *narratives* which follow the order of the biblical text. He broadly refers to the texts as "histories" (as distinct from theological treatise).

2. They are "free standing" literary works that take on the same form as the text that they rewrite. As such, they do not "comment" on the text explicitly, but weave a seamless retelling of the biblical story.

3. They are not meant to replace the biblical work.

4. They cover a great deal of biblical narrative. Here he also notes that certain works which are primarily "expansive" (the Book of Giants, the Book of Noah) probably should not count because their relationship to the biblical text is "centrifugal," while properly RwB texts are "centripetal" to the biblical text.

    >   "Rewritten Bible texts are centripetal: they come back to the Bible again and again. The rewritten Bible texts make use of the legendary material, but by placing that material within an extended biblical narrative (in association with passages of more or less literal retelling of the Bible), they clamp the legends firmly to the biblical framework, and reintegrate them into the biblical history." [@117]

5. They follow the biblical text's narrative order, but do not, necessarily include everything. They are "highly selective in what they represent"[@117], but do not omit so much that the integrity of the biblical account is compromised. He notes "A proper balance between the 'literal' and the 'non-literal' sections is probably of fundamental importance to the genre" [@117].

6. They offer an interpretive reading of Scripture which (quoting Vermes) offer "a fuller, smoother and doctrinally more advanced form of the sacred narrative" [@117 citing @schurer1986, 305] and constitute " a kind of commentary" [@117] which is indirect and whose "full significance can only be grasped if the original is borne constantly in mind" [@117].

7. They are limited by their particular (narrative) form and are only able to offer a single interpretation of the rewritten text. Alexander contrasts this with those of the Rabbis and Philo who are each able to offer multiple interpretations of the a single text, and thus, "treat the underlying text as polyvalent" [@117].

8. They are further limited by their form which does not allow them to explain their exegetical reasoning. 

    >   "The methods by which they solve the problems of the original are essentially midrashic, i.e. similar to those found in the rabbinic midrashim. But unlike the midrashim (or Philo) they cannot make explicit their midrashic working. "[@118]

9.  They incorporate material which is not exegetically derived from the biblical text---such as oral tradition, legends, etc.---and fuse it with the rewritten text: 

    >    "aiming at a synthesis of the whole tradition (both biblical and extra-biblical) within a biblical framework: they seek to unify the tradition on a biblical base." [@118]
