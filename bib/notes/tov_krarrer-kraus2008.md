# Tov (2008)
<!-- Three Strange Books of the LXX -->



Tov addresses three "strange" texts from the LXX which, for one reason or another, differ significantly from the preserved MT (3 Kingdoms, Esther, and Daniel). This article is telling in that it seems to confirm that Tov does not have any interest in formalizing the term "rewriting." Although he draws a distinction between "Rewritten Bible compositions" and these three strange texts, throughout the article, he uses the terms "rewritten," "reworked," and "reshaped," almost interchangeably. 

It seems to me that Tov really isn't interested in the conversation about definitions, so it is, perhaps, unfair to critique his use of the word "rewritten." That said, Tov does seem to place these texts alongside "other" RwB texts. He writes:

> The Hebrew sources of the translations of 1 Kings, Esther, and Daniel freely rewrite their source texts in a manner resembling other rewritten Bible compositions [@386].

In the same way, Tov makes explicit that he understands the SP as participating in this same sort of process as the rewritten texts from Qumran, making special mention of the 11QT^a (The Temple Scroll), Genesis Apocryphon, and Jubilees. Tov, therefore, is attempting to draw a parallel between the sorts of exegetical additions included in these three LXX texts and those included in the SP and the "classical" RwB texts from Qumran. Evoking a number of Segal's criteria[@segal_henze2005] for inclusion in the category (which he acknowledges to be well accepted, if not terribly well defined), Tov suggests that these LXX texts likewise may exhibit 1) a new narrative frame, 2) expansion and abridgement, and 3) a tendentious editorial layer. I would note, however, that Segal's criteria---particularly his insistance on *abridgement* being a major distinguishing factor---were intended to *exclude* texts which envisioned themselves as reproducing their *Vorlage* [@segal_henze2005, 24].

I think it's important to think about what Tov is trying to accomplish in his articles; he is trying to connect the scribal practices which allowed for exegetical additions and emendations to "authoritative texts"---dramatic examples of which are provided by SP and LXX (though one wonders why the Targums aren't included here; perhaps because Tov is arguing for Hebrew *Vorlagen* of these texts, while the Targums represent a translation)---to the practices which produced the *new compositions* which scholars refer to as RwB texts.

I must say, Tov has convinced me that Bernstien was more correct than I could have imagined. I think it's best to simply not consider Tov's use of "rewritten" as a technical term; he uses it in its purely generic form, really. What Tov's articles have shown me, however, is that the issue of *intent* and authorial *purpose* really is at the heart of the distinction between text edition and RwB. Of course, this is not something that can be objectively proven, but it *must* factor into our conversation, even if we must settle for speculation. The result is that, e.g., 4QReworked Pent. should be understood as RwB insofar as we imagine the author attempting something *other* than creating a text edition of the Pentateuch. Presumably the author of GA did not imagine himself creating a new edition of Genesis; the same with Jubilees and Chronicles. The issue of whether the resultant text was used authoritatively after the fact is beside the point; what matters was weather the text was either intended to be, or from the reader's perspective, whether the text was treated as a copy of the text's *Vorlage*. And in the case of SP and LXX (and the Targums, I'd say), this seems to have been the case. Thus, it seems like these should not be treated as RwB.
