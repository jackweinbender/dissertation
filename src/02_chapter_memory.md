# Social Memory Studies and the ~RwB

The past several decades, beginning in the late 1970's, a dramatic increase in scholarly interest toward the topic of "memory" has swept throughout the social sciences. The precipitous rise in scholarly literature dealing with topics of memory coupled with its proliferation in popular media discourses has prompted some in the field to refer to the "memory industry" and to describe the ubiquity of memory discourses as a "boom" fast-approaching a bust.[@rosenfeld_jmh2009; @winter2006; @berliner_aq2005] Yet, as Olick et al. make very clear in their Introduction to *The Collective Memory Reader*, there remain a significant number of scholars throughout the social sciences who continue to find "memory" to a useful heuristic and a compelling theoretical basis for their various and sundry analytical applications.[@olick_olick-etal2011, 3--6] 

Although the topic of "memory" has been of interest philosophers and thinkers since the ancient Greeks, as Olick and Robbins note, the modern social-scientific approaches which concern this chapter almost exclusively trace their genealogy to the early 20th century work of sociologist Maurice Halbwachs.[@olick-robbins_ars1998, 106; It should be noted, however, that Halbwachs was not the first or only person to do work on memory or the impact of society thereon, despite most recent literature's preoccupation with him, see @olick_olick-etal2011, 8--36] Although Halbwachs's work was not limited to exploring the topic of social memory (he also made contributions to statictics and probability theory, as well as sociological work on the topic of suicide and social morphology[@coser_halbwachs1992, 13--20]), his work in this area has managed to endure and continues to find new applications and to inspire new approaches in ways that his other contributions have not.[^publications]

Halbwachs published three primary works on the topic of memory, the first of which, appeared in 1925 under the title *The Social Frameworks of Memory* (*Les cadres sociaxu de la mémoire*). This monograph, along with a short essay dealing with the remembered geography the Holy Land shifted over time by European pilgrims entitled *The Legendary Topography of the Holy Land* (*la topographie légendaire des évangiles en terre sinte: Etude de mémoire collective*) was excerpted and translated by Lewis Coser in a single volume under the title *On Collective Memory* in 1992.[Several of the most important chapters of *The Social Frameowrks of Memory* were included in full. Likewise, the entirety of *The Legendary Topography* was included @halbwachs1992] His final contribution, entitled *The Collective Memory* (*La mémoire collective*), was published posthumously in 1950 and translated into English in 1980 with an editorial introduction by Mary Douglas.[@halbwachs1980] This work simultaneously represents some of Halbwachs's most developed ideas (responding to critics such as Charles Blondel) and evinces an incompleteness which posthumous publications often suffer. As Coser observes, "One may doubt that the author himself would have been willing to publish it in what seems to be an unfinished state. The book nevertheless contains many further developments of Halbwachs's thought in regard to such matters as the relation of space and time to collective memory as well as fruitful definitions and applications of the differences between individual, collective, and historical memory."[@coser_halbwachs1992]

The central contribution of Halbwachs's work was the notion that human memory is intrinsically and inextricably tied to its social context. This focus on the *social* dimensions of memory betrays the deep influence that Émile Durkheim's work had on Halbwachs. Humans are social beings and as such human processes, such as memory, can only be completed within the context of a society. Unlike Durkheim, however, Halbwachs's approach was tempered by his desire to identify the physical (or, perhaps "biological") location of memory within the individual. Although the term "collective memory" evokes an ethereal or metaphysical idea, Halbwachs's use of the term is entirely concrete. Individual memories are kept by *individuals*. However, an individual's ability to retrieve and utilize a particular memory is intrinsically tied to the individual's social context. Memories require social frameworks to function.[@halbwachs1992, 38]

To illustrate this point, Halbwachs begins *The Social Frameworks of Memory* by attempting to prove the negative. *Without* a social framework, he argues, memories are always incomplete. Because humans---for all intents and purposes---always exist within a society, it is the dream state, he avers, that most closely approximates the complete isolation of memory from society. Therefor the way that the human brain deals with memories while dreaming can illustrate the (dis)function of memories lacking a social framework. Thus, he observes that "dreams are composed of fragments of memory too mutilated and mixed up with others to allow us to recognize them." Because in dream states the mind lacks the ability to "check" itself against anything external to itself, dreams do not contain "true memories."[@halbwachs1992, 41] This assertion is set against the "purely individual psychology" (read: Bergson, et al.), which viewed *memory* as a location of social isolation. Regarding the incompleteness of the dream state, he writes:

> Almost completely detached from the system of social representations, [the dream state's] images are nothing more than raw materials, capable of entering into all sorts of combinations. They establish only random relations among each other---relations based on the disordered play of corporal modification.[@halbwachs1992, 42]

The "system of social representations" that Halbwachs refers to is not limited, however, to macro structures such as familial, religious, or class groups. Although these structures certainly *do* make up an important stratum of social frameworks, Halbwachs envisions something much more fundamental which betrays his broadly structuralist perspective. Halbwachs uses the phrase "social representations" to refer to a  system of  shared "signs" that encompassed not only language, but every aspect of a group's social framework---a sort of "cultural *langue*." Although, Halbwachs does not use the language of semiotics, the analogy is helpful. Just as Saussurian linguistics argues that the concrete arbitrary sign is given meaning only by participating in the broader, shared *langue*, so too memories (read: "signs") require a framework to convey meaning, as do the concrete, individual expressions of remembrance (read: *parole*). Memories, therefore, cannot be understood in isolation from their social framework and therefore should not be analyzed without consideration to the social context of the rememberer. 

While this example makes up only a small part of Halbwachs's work, it is representative of his central thesis and provides a point of departure for his more in-depth studies of collective memory in the family, religion, and social classes. Social frameworks shape the way that people remember. The retrieval of memories is shaped by those same frameworks, and as those frameworks shift, so too do the memories that are recalled in those societies.

Halbwachs also distinguished between two kinds of memory which were distinguished by the relation of the individual to the experience of the memory: autobiographical and historical. Autobiographical memory refers to the sort of memories which are the result of individual, subjective experience, while historical memory refers to memories which fall outside the experience of the individual. Autobiographical memory naturally includes memories of events that the rememberer personally participated in, or of people directly known. But it also includes memories of a more indirect nature that nevertheless shape the memory of an individual. The quintessential example of this sort of indirect autobiographical memory for Americans of roughly my age would be the events of September 11, 2001. Although comparatively few people directly witnessed the events (I was asleep on the West Coast when the first plane crashed), the impact that those events had (and continue to have) on the orientation of American national memory is unquestionably a part of many people's lived experience. On the other hand, the events of the American Civil War, although its impact continues to be seen in contemporary American discourse, is not a part of any living person's autobiographical memory.[@olick_olick-etal2011, 19] Both of these, however, are shaped by the social frameworks of the rememberer. Thus, the events of September 11, 2001, now, are shaped by the social discourses surrounding the United States's military presence in the region and the controversial pretexts for engagement in the region, in particular with the Iraq war. Likewise the construction (and recent removal) of certain confederate monuments on the campus of the University of Texas at Austin illustrates how historical memory can be (consciously, in this case) reshaped and restructured as the remembering society changes.

Of course, people participate in a plurality of social groups, often simultaneously, and the experiences that are later to be recalled, too, must be situated within these frameworks. In order to bring these autobiographical memories to mind, according to Halbwachs, an individual attempts to mentally situate herself within those same frameworks. For instance, I find it much easier to recall whether a particular course I have taken occurred in the Fall or Spring semester, rather than which month or even year it occurred. The social framework that is the "academic year" remains a potent framework for my own memories, while my wife---who had the good sense to stop after one degree---stopped remembering in terms of "semesters" years ago. Yet, when remembering events during her time at the University, the semester once again becomes a useful framework for memory.  It is for this reason that recent memories are more easy to call to mind: because the social frameworks that produced the memory (the people, places, customs, etc.) remain in close proximity for the rememberer and the effort required to situate the memory within the social frameworks that produced it is minimal.[@halbwachs1992, 52] 



## Collective Memory, and Cultural Memory, and Social Memory: A Terminological Assessment

Although Halbwachs used the term "collective memory" to talk about the interaction between memory at the individual, psychological level and the social frameworks which enable the act of recollection, recent work in memory studies has seen a proliferation of terminology which has both clarified and (at times) obfuscated the discussion.[^terminology]

[^terminology]: In fact, there is a grand tradition of imprecise and overlapping terminologies within memory studies going back to Halbwachs himself. For example, on page 40 of *On Collective Memory*, Halbwachs uses the terms "collective memory," "social memory," "social frameworks of memory," and "collective frameworks of memory" and it is not entirely clear what how Halbwachs is distinguishing between them. The way that he is able to use the terms almost interchangeably has led some in the current discussion to treat them as synonyms. As Anthony Le Donne observes, "In fact, ["social" and "collective" memory] are currently used synonymously with such frequency that their nuances vary from author to author [@ledonne2009, 42 n.8]. Yet, Le Donne points out, Halbwachs actually uses these terms in with slightly different nuances. On the one hand, Halbwachs uses the term "sociaux" when he is describing the way social structures affect memory, while on the other hand "Collective Memory" tends to refer to the content of memories which are transmitted between individuals [@ledonne2009, 42 n.8]. In other words, when Halbawachs uses the term "social" he is usually talking about *frameworks* of memory, whereas "collective memory" might be cautiously glossed as "common" or "shared" memory. Sandra Hübenthal puts it well, "The difference [between social and collective memory] lies in the perspective: _social memory_ is using the framework, _collective memory_ is establishing it" [@hubenthal_carstens-hasselbalch2012, 180].
