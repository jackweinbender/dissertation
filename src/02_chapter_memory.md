# Memory and the ~RwB

The past several decades has seen a dramatic increase in interest toward the topic of "memory" throughout the social sciences. 

As Olick and Robbins note, although the topic of "memory" has been of interest philosophers and thinkers since the ancient Greeks, the modern social-scientific approaches which concern this chapter almost exclusively trace their genealogy to the early 20th century work of sociologist Maurice Halbwachs.[@olick-robbins_ars1998, 106] Although Halbwachs's work was not limited to exploring the topic of social memory (he also made contributions to statictics and probability theory, as well as sociological work on the topic of suicide and social morphology[@coser_halbwachs1992, 13--20]), his work in this area has managed to endure and continues to find new applications and to inspire new approaches in ways that his other contributions have not. 

Halbwachs's seminal work on the topic of memory, published in 1925 under the title *Les cadres sociaxu de la mémoire* (hereafter refered to in translation as "The Social Frameworks of Memory") was excerpted and translated into English in 1992 by Lewis Coser along with the final chapter of his short book on the remembrance of the Holy Land (entitled *la topographie légendaire des évangiles en  terre sinte: Etude de mémoire collective*, hereafter referred to in translation as "The Legendary Topography of the Holy Land") in a single volume under the title *On Collective Memory*.[@halbwachs1992] These two works, in some sense, form the core of Halbwachs's work. A thrid volume, however, entitled *La mémoire collective* (hereafter, *The Collective Memory*) was published posthumously in 1950 and translated into English in 1980 by Mary Douglass. This work simultaneously represents some of Halbwachs's most nuanced ideas (while responding to critics) and evinces an incompleteness which posthumous publications often suffer.[Coser observes, "One may doubt that the author himself would have been willing to publish it in what seems to be an unfinished state. The book nevertheless contains many further developments of Halbwachs's thought in regard to such matters as the relation of space and time to collective memory as well as fruitful definitions and applications of the differences between individual, collective, and historical memory." @coser_halbwachs1992, 2]

The central contribution of Halbwachs's work was the notion that human memory is intrinsically and inextricably tied to its social context. Humans are social beings and the recollection of memeories can only be completed within the context of a society. Halbwachs, of course, locates what we might call the biologocal processes of memory within the individual, but he, argues, memories divorced from society yeild an incomplete picture.[halbwachs1992, 38] To illustrate this point, Halbwachs begins *The Social Frameworks of Memory* with a discussion of dreams wherein he argues that the dream state approximates human isolation from society in a particularly potent way. He writes:

> It is at this moment [in the dream state] that he is no longer capable---nor has need---of relying on frames of collective memory. It is then possible to measure the operation of these frameworks by observing what becomes of individual memory when this operation is no longer present.[@halbwachs1992, 39]

Contra Freud *et, al.*, Halbwachs argues that it is not in *memory* that the human mind is most isolated, but rather in the dream state. Memory, on the other hand *cannot* be understood in isolation from its social framework. This is why, according to Halbwachs,  "[no] real and complete memory ever appears in our dreams as it appears in our waking state,"[@halbwachs1992, 41] Halbwach is able to argue that it is the social frameworks of memory which anchor human memory.
