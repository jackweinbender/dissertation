# Social Memory Studies and the ~RwB

The past several decades, beginning in the late 1970's, a dramatic increase in scholarly interest toward the topic of "memory" has swept throughout the social sciences. The precipitous rise in scholarly literature dealing with topics of memory coupled with its proliferation in popular media discourses has prompted some in the field to refer to the "memory industry" and to describe the ubiquity of memory discourses as a "boom" fast-approaching a bust.[@rosenfeld_jmh2009; @winter2006; @berliner_aq2005] Yet, as Olick et al. make very clear in their Introduction to *The Collective Memory Reader*, there remain a significant number of scholars throughout the social sciences who continue to find "memory" to a useful heuristic and a compelling theoretical basis for their various and sundry analytical applications.[@olick_olick-etal2011, 3--6] 

Although the topic of "memory" has been of interest philosophers and thinkers since the ancient Greeks, as Olick and Robbins note, the modern social-scientific approaches which concern this chapter almost exclusively trace their genealogy to the early 20th century work of sociologist Maurice Halbwachs.[@olick-robbins_ars1998, 106; It should be noted, however, that Halbwachs was not the first or only person to do work on memory or the impact of society thereon, despite most recent literature's preoccupation with him, see @olick_olick-etal2011, 8--36] Although Halbwachs's work was not limited to exploring the topic of social memory (he also made contributions to statictics and probability theory, as well as sociological work on the topic of suicide and social morphology[@coser_halbwachs1992, 13--20]), his work in this area has managed to endure and continues to find new applications and to inspire new approaches in ways that his other contributions have not.[^publications]

[^publications]: Halbwachs's seminal work on the topic of memory, published in 1925 under the title *The Social Frameworks of Memory* (*Les cadres sociaxu de la mémoire*) was excerpted and translated into English in 1992 by Lewis Coser along with the final chapter of his short book on the remembrance of the Holy Land, entitled *The Legendary Topography of the Holy Land* (*la topographie légendaire des évangiles en terre sinte: Etude de mémoire collective*) in a single volume under the title *On Collective Memory*.[@halbwachs1992] These two works, in some sense, form the core of Halbwachs's work. A third volume, however, entitled *The Collective Memory* (*La mémoire collective*) was published posthumously in 1950 and translated into English in 1980 with an editorial introduction by Mary Douglas.[@halbwachs1980] This work simultaneously represents some of Halbwachs's most developed ideas (while responding to critics) and evinces an incompleteness which posthumous publications often suffer. As Coser observes, "One may doubt that the author himself would have been willing to publish it in what seems to be an unfinished state. The book nevertheless contains many further developments of Halbwachs's thought in regard to such matters as the relation of space and time to collective memory as well as fruitful definitions and applications of the differences between individual, collective, and historical memory."[@coser_halbwachs1992]

The central contribution of Halbwachs's work was the notion that human memory is intrinsically and inextricably tied to its social context. This focus on the *social* dimensions of memory betrays the deep influence that Émile Durkheim's work had on Halbwachs. Humans are social beings and as such human processes, such as memory, can only be completed within the context of a society. Unlike Durkheim, however, Halbwachs's approach was tempered by his desire to identify the physical (or, perhaps "biological") location of memory within the individual. Although the term "collective memory" evokes an ethereal or metaphysical idea, Halbwachs's use of the term is entirely concrete. Individual memories are kept by *individuals*. However, an individuals' ability to retrieve and utilize a particular memory is intrinsically tied to the individual's social context. Memories require social frameworks to function.[halbwachs1992, 38] 

To illustrate this point, Halbwachs begins *The Social Frameworks of Memory* by attempting to prove the negative. *Without* a social framework, he argues, memories are always incomplete. Because humans---for all intents and purposes---always exist within a society, it is the dream state, he avers, that most closely approximates the complete isolation of memory from society. Therefor the way that the human brain deals with memories while dreaming can illustrate the (dis)function of memories lacking a social framework. Thus, he observes that "dreams are composed of fragments of memory too mutilated and mixed up with others to allow us to recognize them." Because in dream states the mind lacks the ability to "check" itself against anything external to itself, dreams do not contain "true memories."[@halbwachs1992, 41] This assertion is set against the "purely individual psychology" (read: Freud, et al.), which viewed *memory* as a location of social isolation. Regarding the incompleteness of the dream state, he writes:

> Almost completely detached from the system of social representations, [the dream state's] images are nothing more than raw materials, capable of entering into all sorts of combinations. They establish only random relations among each other---relations based on the disordered play of corporal modification.[@halbwachs1992, 42]

Memory, therefore, cannot be understood in isolation from its social framework and therefore should not be analyzed without consideration to the social context of the rememberer. 

While this example makes up only a small part of Halbwachs's work, it is representative of his central thesis and provides a point of departure for his more in-depth studies of collective memory in the family, religion, and social classes. Social frameworks shape the way that people remember. The retrieval of memories is shaped by those same frameworks, and as those frameworks shift, so too do the memories that are recalled in those societies.



## Collective Memory, and Cultural Memory, and Social Memory: A Terminological Assessment

Although Halbwachs used the term "collective memory" to talk about the interaction between memory at the individual, psychological level and the social frameworks which enable the act of recollection, recent work in memory studies has seen a proliferation of terminology which has both clarified and (at times) obfuscated discussion. In fact, there is a grand tradition of imprecise and overlapping terminologies within memory studies, the chief proprietor of which is no other than Halbwachs himself. 

Halbwachs does not always make clear what he means when he uses the terms "collective memory" versus "social memory" versus "social frameworks of memory" versus "collective frameworks of memory" (all found, e.g., on p. 40 of *On Collective Memory*).[@halbwachs1992] The way that he is able to use the terms almost interchangeably has led some in the current discussion to treat them as synonyms.[Anthony Le Donne observes, "In fact, they are currently used synonymously with such frequency that their nuances vary from author to author." @ledonne2009, 42 n.8] Yet, as Le Donne, has noted, Halbwachs actually uses these terms in with slightly different nuances. On the one hand, Halbwachs uses the term "sociaux" when he is describing the way social structures affect memory, while on the other hand "Collective Memory" tends to refer to the content of memories which are transmitted between individuals.[@ledonne2009, 42 n.8] In other words, when Halbawachs uses the term "social" he is usually talking about *frameworks* of memory, whereas "collective memory" might be cautiously glossed as "common" or "shared" memory.[As Hübenthal puts it, "The difference [between social and collective memory] lies in the perspective: _social memory_ is using the framework, _collective memory_ is establishing it." @hubenthal_carstens-hasselbalch2012, 180]
