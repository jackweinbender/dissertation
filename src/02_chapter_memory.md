# Social Memory Studies and the ~RwB

The past several decades, beginning in the late 1970's, a dramatic increase in scholarly interest toward the topic of "memory" has swept throughout the social sciences. The precipitous rise in scholarly literature dealing with topics of memory coupled with its proliferation in popular media discourses has prompted some in the field to refer to the "memory industry" and to describe the ubiquity of memory discourses as a "boom" fast-approaching a bust.[@rosenfeld_jmh2009; @winter2006; @berliner_aq2005] Yet, as Olick et al. make very clear in their Introduction to *The Collective Memory Reader*, there remain a significant number of scholars throughout the social sciences who continue to find "memory" to a useful heuristic and a compelling theoretical basis for their various and sundry analytical applications.[@olick_olick-etal2011, 3--6] 

Although the topic of "memory" has been of interest philosophers and thinkers since the ancient Greeks, as Olick and Robbins note, the modern social-scientific approaches which concern this chapter almost exclusively trace their genealogy to the early 20th century work of sociologist Maurice Halbwachs.[@olick-robbins_ars1998, 106; It should be noted, however, that Halbwachs was not the first or only person to do work on memory or the impact of society thereon, despite most recent literature's preoccupation with him, see @olick_olick-etal2011, 8--36] Although Halbwachs's work was not limited to exploring the topic of social memory (he also made contributions to statictics and probability theory, as well as sociological work on the topic of suicide and social morphology[@coser_halbwachs1992, 13--20]), his work in this area has managed to endure and continues to find new applications and to inspire new approaches in ways that his other contributions have not.

## The Work of Maurice Halbwachs: A Very Brief Overview

Halbwachs published three primary works on the topic of memory, the first of which appeared in 1925 under the title *The Social Frameworks of Memory* (*Les cadres sociaxu de la mémoire*). This monograph, along with a short essay dealing with the remembered geography the Holy Land, entitled *The Legendary Topography of the Holy Land* (*la topographie légendaire des évangiles en terre sinte: Etude de mémoire collective*) was excerpted and translated by Lewis Coser in a single volume under the title *On Collective Memory* in 1992.[Several of the most important chapters of *The Social Frameowrks of Memory* were included in full. Likewise, the entirety of the conclusion of *The Legendary Topography* was included @halbwachs1992] His final contribution, entitled *The Collective Memory* (*La mémoire collective*), was published posthumously in 1950 and translated into English in 1980 with an editorial introduction by Mary Douglas.[@halbwachs1980] This work simultaneously represents some of Halbwachs's most developed ideas (responding to critics such as Charles Blondel) and evinces an incompleteness which posthumous publications often suffer. As Coser observes, "One may doubt that the author himself would have been willing to publish it in what seems to be an unfinished state. The book nevertheless contains many further developments of Halbwachs's thought in regard to such matters as the relation of space and time to collective memory as well as fruitful definitions and applications of the differences between individual, collective, and historical memory."[@coser_halbwachs1992]

The central contribution of Halbwachs's work was the notion that human memory is intrinsically and inextricably tied to social frameworks. Humans are social beings and as such human processes, such as memory, can only be completed within the context of a society. This focus on the *social* dimensions of memory betrays the deep influence that Émile Durkheim's work had on Halbwachs. Unlike Durkheim, however, Halbwachs's approach was tempered by his desire to identify the physical (or, perhaps "biological") location of memory within the individual. Although the term "collective memory" evokes an ethereal or metaphysical idea, Halbwachs's use of the term is entirely concrete. Individual memories are kept by *individuals*. However, an individual's ability to retrieve and utilize a particular memory is intrinsically tied to the individual's social context. Memories require social frameworks to function.[@halbwachs1992, 38]

To illustrate this point, Halbwachs begins *The Social Frameworks of Memory* by attempting to prove the negative. *Without* a social framework, he argues, memories are always incomplete. Because humans---for all intents and purposes---always exist within a society, it is the dream state, he avers, that most closely approximates the complete isolation of memory from society. Therefor the way that the human brain deals with memories while dreaming can illustrate the (dis)function of memories lacking a social framework. Thus, he observes that "dreams are composed of fragments of memory too mutilated and mixed up with others to allow us to recognize them." Because in dream states the mind lacks the ability to "check" itself against anything external to itself, dreams do not contain "true memories."[@halbwachs1992, 41] This assertion is set against the "purely individual psychology" (read: Bergson, et al.), which viewed *memory* as a location of social isolation. Regarding the incompleteness of the dream state, he writes:

> Almost completely detached from the system of social representations, [the dream state's] images are nothing more than raw materials, capable of entering into all sorts of combinations. They establish only random relations among each other---relations based on the disordered play of corporal modification.[@halbwachs1992, 42]

The "system of social representations" that Halbwachs refers to is not limited, however, to macro structures such as familial, religious, or class groups. Although these structures certainly *do* make up an important stratum of social frameworks, Halbwachs envisions something much more fundamental which betrays his broadly structuralist perspective. Halbwachs uses the phrase "social representations" to refer to a  system of  shared "signs" that encompassed not only language, but every aspect of a group's social framework---a sort of "cultural *langue*." Although, Halbwachs does not use the language of semiotics, the analogy is helpful. Just as Saussurian linguistics argues that the concrete arbitrary sign is given meaning only by participating in the broader, shared *langue*, so too memories (read: "signs") require a framework to convey meaning, as do the concrete, individual expressions of remembrance (read: *parole*). Halbwachs writes:

> It is in this sense that there exists a collective memory and social frameworks for memory; it is to the degree that our individual thought places itself in these frameworks and participates in this memory that it is capable of the act of recollection.[@halbwachs1992b].

Memories, therefore, cannot be understood in isolation from their social framework and therefore should not be analyzed without consideration to the social context of the rememberer. 

Of course, people participate in a plurality of social groups, often simultaneously, and the experiences that are later to be recalled, too, must be situated within these frameworks. In order to bring these autobiographical memories to mind, according to Halbwachs, an individual attempts to mentally situate herself within those same frameworks. For instance, I find it much easier to recall whether a particular course I have taken occurred in the Fall or Spring semester, rather than which month or even year it occurred. The social framework that is the "academic year" remains a potent framework for my own memories, while my wife---who had the good sense to stop after one degree---stopped remembering in terms of "semesters" years ago. Yet, when remembering events during her time at the University, the semester once again becomes a useful framework for memory.  It is for this reason that recent memories are more easy to call to mind: because the social frameworks that produced the memory (the people, places, customs, etc.) remain in close proximity for the rememberer and the effort required to situate the memory within the social frameworks that produced it is minimal.[@halbwachs1992, 52] 

This overview is representative of his central thesis and provides a point of departure for his more in-depth studies of collective memory in the family, religion, and social classes. Thus, by "social" memory, Halbwachs refers to individual memory and how it is recalled within externally defined social frameworks, i.e. how society provides the framework that makes individual memory possible.[@hubenthal2012, 180] On the other hand, "collective" memory refers to shared memory, "the shared cultural past to which individuals contribute and upon which they call; but ultimately a past that transcends individual memory."[@keith2015a, 360; See also @hubenthal2012, 180] The two ideas work together and mutually influence one another. As Hübenthal puts it, "The difference [between social and collective memory] lies in the perspective: *social memory* is using the framework, *collective memory* is establishing it."[@hubenthal2012, 180.] Hübenthal's use of the active verb "establish" is intentional: for Halbwachs, collective memory is not a passive social accretion, but an actively constructed part of the group's common identity which *speaks to the to concerns and needs of the community in the present*.  Social frameworks shape the way that people remember. The retrieval of memories is shaped by those same frameworks, and as those frameworks shift, so too do the memories that are recalled in those societies. 

## Memory and History

In his later work, Halbwachs distinguished between two kinds of memory which were distinguished by the experiential-relation of the individual to the memory: autobiographical and historical memory.[@halbwachs1980, 52] Autobiographical memory refers to the sort of memories which are the result of individual, subjective experience, while historical memory refers to memories which fall outside the experience of the individual. Elsewhere Halbwachs refers to these as "internal" and "external" memory. Autobiographical memory is rooted in the individual, sensory, experiences of the individual and provides a full, "thick" memory (to borrow from Geertz) while historical memory, necessarily, offers only a thin, schematic overview and by definition is never "experienced" by the rememberer.

Although Halbwachs distinguished between these two forms of memory, he nevertheless emphasized their interrelatedness. In particular, Halbwachs notes that autobiographical memory necessarily is dependent upon historical memory, insofar as our lives participate in "general history."[@halbwachs1980, 52] For example, memories of a more indirect nature are able to shape autobiographical memory by shaping the social frameworks which produced them and the frameworks into which they are recalled. The quintessential example of this sort of indirect influence for Americans of roughly my age would be the events of September 11, 2001. Although comparatively few people directly witnessed the events (I was asleep on the West Coast when the first plane crashed), the impact that those events had (and continue to have) on the orientation of American national memory is unquestionably a part of many people's lived experience, including my own and would therefore constitute a part of America's current "collective memory." Although the incoming undergraduate class at the University of Texas at Austin, many of whom will have been born after 2001, have *no* autobiographical memory of these events, it is, nonetheless, a part of the collective memory of which they are a part. On the other hand the War of 1812 is not a part of any living person's autobiographical memory and its impact on the collective memory of most Americans is likely restricted to a few popular media references,[^Such as Jimmy Driftwood's *The Battle of New Orleans*, best known as performed by Johnny Horton which topped *Billboard* charts in the US, Canada, and Australia in 1959 and was recently  acknowledged to be on of the Top 100 Western songs of all time. See, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Battle_of_New_Orleans.] or localized to specific geographical regions with a close connection to major events in the conflict (e.g., New Orleans). 

The memories of historical events, however, are shaped by the social frameworks of the rememberer. The events of September 11, 2001 in the memory of most Americans are now shaped by the social discourses surrounding the United States's continued military presence in the region and its controversial pretexts for engagement in the region, in particular with the Iraq war. Likewise, although no living person has an autobiographical memory of the American Civil War, the construction of certain confederate monuments on the campus of the University of Texas at Austin   during the Jim Crow era, and their subsequent removal in August of 2017, illustrates how historical memory can be (consciously, in this case) reshaped and restructured as the remembering society changes.

It is the way that these remembered events change over time that makes social memory studies so  interesting for the historian. Halbwachs's won work in the area of history is best seen in his work on *The Legendary Topography of the Holy Land*, where he focuses on the ways that memories relate to particular geographic sites. In particular, Halbwachs's study focuses on the way that the sites in and around the Galilee and Jerusalem have been imbued with significance based on their putative connection with some significant event relating to Jesus, the Apostles, and early Christian communities. Halbwachs makes a number observations about the way that memories are formed and the ways that they interact which will become important for the current study.

Halbwachs's first observation comes in contrasting the portrayal of Jesus within the Gospels with what must have been the lived experience of the Apostles.[@halbwachs1992, 193--198] The involvement of the apostles in the day-to-day life of Jesus in some sense would have prohibited them from achieving the kind of "necessary detachment" to write something like the the Gospels. In other words (and to use Halbwachs's later terminology), the memory of Jesus as protrayed in the Gospels is almost necessarily must be informed by *historical* rather than autobiographical memory.[@halbwachs1992, 194] Indeed, Halbwachs rightly observes that the Gospels present Jesus and his ministry "as if Jesus's whole life was but a preparation for his death, as if this was what he had announced in advance."[@halbwachs1992, 198] Surely Jesus's mother remembered the death of her son differently than the way the Church later commemorated it.

Halbwachs, drawing on the Pauline epistles, observes that the earliest recollections of Jesus, however, make no mention of the location of his death (Jerusalem) nor of his ministry (Galilee).

> In the authentic epistles of Paul, we are told only that the son of God has come to earth, that he died for our sins, and that he was brought back to life again. There is no allusion to the circumstances of his life, except for the Lord's Supper, which, Paul says, appeared to him in a vision (and not through witnesses). There is no indication of locality, no question of Galilee, or of the preachings of Jesus on the shores of the lake of Gennesaret.[@halbwachs1992, 209]

It is worth noting that Halbachs himself compares his basic sentiment toward the historicity of the Gospels as similar to that of Ernst Renan. Of course, the field of New Testament studies has progressed considerably in content, method, and nuance beyond Renan, whatever the merits of his work may have been. While Halbachs seems to take seriously that Jesus did exist, he does not accept the Gospels at face value as historically accurate. That said, throughout the work, Halbwachs does talk about the "actual" past and allows for the possibility that the Gospels do refer, at least partially, to these real events. Which is to say, he is not making the argument that the Gospels were fabricated of whole-cloth, but that the "actual past" is irretrievable and unknowable and that historical memory has no obligation to align with the actual past as such.

Regardless of whether Halbwachs's conception of Early Christianity would be considered sound today, the idea that the Gospels represent several collective remembrances of Jesus's life, ministry and death each bearing marks from their own *Sitz im Leben* (to borrow from the form critics) seems relatively uncontroversial.[Indeed, a number of studies on the Jesus and early Christian memory have come about in the past several years. See @ledonne2009; @rodriguez2010a; For an overview of the modern impact of Halbwachs (and memory studies more generally) on the field of Historical Jesus studies, see @keith_ec2015 and @keith_ec2015b]

### Modern Theories of Memory



## Collective Memory, and Cultural Memory, and Social Memory: A Terminological Assessment

Although Halbwachs used the term "collective memory" to talk about the interaction between memory at the individual, psychological level and the social frameworks which enable the act of recollection, recent work in memory studies has seen a proliferation of terminology which has both clarified and (at times) obfuscated the discussion.[^terminology]

[^terminology]: In fact, there is a grand tradition of imprecise and overlapping terminologies within memory studies going back to Halbwachs himself. For example, on page 40 of *On Collective Memory*, Halbwachs uses the terms "collective memory," "social memory," "social frameworks of memory," and "collective frameworks of memory" and it is not entirely clear what how Halbwachs is distinguishing between them. The way that he is able to use the terms almost interchangeably has led some in the current discussion to treat them as synonyms. As Anthony Le Donne observes, "In fact, ["social" and "collective" memory] are currently used synonymously with such frequency that their nuances vary from author to author [@ledonne2009, 42 n.8]. Yet, Le Donne points out, Halbwachs actually uses these terms in with slightly different nuances. On the one hand, Halbwachs uses the term "sociaux" when he is describing the way social structures affect memory, while on the other hand "Collective Memory" tends to refer to the content of memories which are transmitted between individuals [@ledonne2009, 42 n.8]. In other words, when Halbawachs uses the term "social" he is usually talking about *frameworks* of memory, whereas "collective memory" might be cautiously glossed as "common" or "shared" memory. Sandra Hübenthal puts it well, "The difference [between social and collective memory] lies in the perspective: _social memory_ is using the framework, _collective memory_ is establishing it" [@hubenthal_carstens-hasselbalch2012, 180].
