# Memory and the ~RwB


## The State of Memory Studies
Broadly speaking Memory Studies---which I will use as shorthand for Social/Collective/Cultural Memory Studies---has enjoyed something of a boom over the past few decades spanning the fields of Sociology, Anthropology, and History. Such trends tend to take a bit of extra time to permeate the diverse fields subsumed under the umbrella of "Biblical Studies." Yet, over the past several years, "memory" has begun to become a major part of the discourse surrounding the traditions, texts, and histories of the Bible. Along with some very interesting ideas, memory studies has brought with it a good deal of (particularly) terminological baggage and confusion.[@hubenthal2012, 177-9] Speaking about Memory Studies as a monolith is about has helpful as talking about "Biblical Studies" as a monolith---the field is wide, varied, and not rarely based on common methodological assumptions. So, although the term Memory Studies is useful in referring to the entirety of the scholarly discourse surrounding Memory, it is not terribly useful when describing a particular application of the various theories and methodologies related to memory.

Yet, even the more nuanced terms such as "Social Memory," "Cultural Memory," and "Collective Memory" (to name but a few) are often poorly defined and at times used interchangeably with one another. The fragmented state of the taxonomies surrounding Memory Studies is reflected in various and sundry applications of Memory Theory within the field of Biblical Studies. As such, I will attempt to organize this "state of the field" section around these oft-confused terms.

### Social \& Collective Memory
Maurice Halbwachs---a student of Henri Bergson and often credited as the father of modern memory theory---used the terms "social memory" and "collective memory" to describe two related but distinct ideas about how groups remember.[@halbwachs1992b] By "social" memory, Halbwachs refers to the way that individuals recall the past within externally defined social frameworks, i.e. how society provides the framework that makes individual memory possible and therefore sets the boundaries of the memory.[@hubenthal2012, 180] On the other hand, "collective" memory refers to shared memory, "the shared cultural past to which individuals contribute and upon which they call; but ultimately a past that transcends individual memory."[@keith2015a, 360; See also @hubenthal2012, 180] The two ideas work together and mutually influence one another.[^interaction] As Hübenthal puts it, "The difference [between social and collective memory] lies in the perspective: _social memory_ is using the framework, _collective memory_ is establishing it."[@hubenthal2012, 180.] Hübenthal's use of the active verb "establish" is intentional: for Halbwachs, collective memory is not a passive social accretion, but an actively constructed part of the group's common identity which _speaks to the to concerns and needs of the community in the present_. As such, there is no meaningful, necessary, relationship between the collective memory and the actual past.[@hubenthal2012, 181] This is a key concept within memory studies.

[^interaction]: Halbwachs writes, "It is in this sense that there exists a collective memory and social frameworks for memory; it is to the degree that our individual thought places itself in these frameworks and participates in this memory that it is capable of the act of recollection."[@halbwachs1992b].

While Halbwachs is known as the "godfather" of memory studies, few modern authors utilize his theoretical framework without major caveat do to the positivist tendencies endemic to 20th century scholarship.

### Communicative \& Cultural Memory (_Kommunikatives und Kulturelles Gedächtnis_)

While Halbwach's terminology is more widely used in English-speaking scholarship, within German scholarship, the work of Aleida and Jan Assmann and the terminology associated with their work is preferred. But here again, the issue is not simply a matter of synonyms; the terms _Kommunikatives Gedächtnis_ (Communicative Memory) and _Kulturelles Gedächtnis_ (Cultural Memory) represent a subset of Halbwach's _collective_ memory, but with a more concrete ethnological foundation.[@assmann2008, 110; @hubenthal2012, 182; See also @assmann2011, 34--50.] Communicative Memory represents a synchronic, or "horizontal" memory shared by a society at a particular chronological horizon, based on direct communication between individuals. To oversimplify a bit, it is the shared memory and experience of a whole, living, society. According to Assmann, this memory has a temporal horizon of approximately 80--100 years---limited by spacial (where people are) and chronological (how long people live) factors. At the end of this 80--100 year period---as the memory begins to lose relevance and those with direct connections to the events, people, and places which the memories involve---the memory will either be forgotten or transformed by the remembering community into some other form for more long-term transmission. Here again, the _active_ participation of the remembering group is key. The canonization of memory at the end of this period is a conscious, _constructive_ activity by a group, the result of which is Cultural Memory.[@hubenthal2012, 182--183]

Cultural Memory is the term used for the diachronic transmission of memories among a particular group. These memories so not represent a random accretion of meaningless archaisms, but are a carefully selected and curated set of ideas, texts, monuments, etc. which provide meaning to the group _in the present_.[^myth-and-history] Within societies which have scribal apparatuses, writing is a common solution to the "crisis of memory" that occurs at the end of the communicative period.[@assmann2006, 63--80; @kirk2005, 6] A similar crisis of memory may occur in times of cultural instability, as Kirk observes, "In such cases a society is confronted with loss of connection to memory and so turns more intensively to writing as a means of stabilizing group memory, of working out connections to the past in the midst of drastically altered circumstances."[@kirk2005, 6] Again, it is worth pointing out that the "stabilization" of memory should not be equated with "fidelity" to the actual past, but rather the ability of a society as a whole to share an identity based on a _percieved_ past that it has constructed.

[^myth-and-history]: Here again, the "remembered past" should not be confused with the "actual" past. As Assmann notes, "in the context of cultural memory, the distinction between myth and history vanishes." [@assmann2008, 113]. As side note, this notion will be important for how I am able to deal with Chronicles, Jubilees, and Genesis Apocryphon together. I will also be looking into works on historiography such as [@veyne1988].

Unsurprisingly, within Hebrew Bible studies, the Assmanns' approach has been very influential and has been utilized by a number of scholars (with varying levels of engagement with Assmann's theoretical framework, some explicit, some implicit, and far too many only bibliographically) including Ehud ben Zvi,[^ben-zvi] Diana Edelman,[@edelman2012; @edelman2013] Ron Hendel,[@hendel2005, @hendel2010b] and Philip Davies,[@davies2008] to name but a few.

[^ben-zvi]: [@ben-zvi2013; @ben-zvi2012] among so many others---he has a regular cottage industry of memory papers going.

The Hebrew Bible is almost always discussed in the context of cultural memory---only rarely could it conceivably fit into the framework of communicative memory.[^communicative] In some respects, therefore, this approach is the successor to the tradition-historical approaches of the 20th century associated with, among others, Gerhard von Rad. As it happens, Assmann (an Egyptologist) himself has done some work on the religion of Israel through the lens of cultural memory[@assmann1998; @assmann2014; and more generally on religion @assmann2006.]

[^communicative]: A possible exception could be Ezra and Nehemiah, or (depending on how one dates the texts) certain prophetic works. Yet, all of these _texts_ (an important point in itself vis-à-vis the discussion) were selected and preserved by a community, which makes them a part of cultural memory---at least in their current form. New Testament scholarship, on the other hand, has fruitfully utilized both cultural and communicative frameworks. The short period of time in which the bulk of the NT material was produced is more conducive to communicative memory studies, particularly in Historical Jesus studies. See [@keith2015a; @keith2015b; @hubenthal2012; @le-donne2009; @rodriguez2010a].

### The Continuity Perspective
The approach of Halbwachs and that of the Assmanns is thoroughly constructivist. According to these theorists, the "actual past" simply has no bearing on, in particular, cultural memory (or collective memory, in Halbwach's terms). These scholars therefore make up the so-called "constructivist" or "presentist" perspective. Another perspective---primarily associated with the American sociologist Barry Schwartz---has been termed the "continuity" (or "essentialist") perspective because of its insistence on the fact that the actual past carries some "normative" force. Schwartz critiques Halbwach's saying:

> Unfortunately, this [Halbwachs’s presentist] perspective has problems of its own. It promotes the idea that our conception of the past is entirely at the mercy of current conditions, that there is no objectivity in events, nothing in history which transcends the peculiarities of the present.[@schwartz1982, 376]

At the heart of the so-called “continuity” approach is the conviction that while memories are often—perhaps always—conditioned by the present, there is a limit to the amount of distortion acceptable to the remembering community. As Michael Schudson puts it, "The past is in some respects and under some conditions, highly resistant to efforts to make it over."[@schudson1989, 107]

Schwartz also built on Halbwach's notion of the interaction between social and collective memory. Schwartz understands this two-way interaction between the remembered past and the present in terms of “keying” and “framing.” _Keying_ provides a mechanism by which people are able to associate present figures with those of the remembered past---offering a shared context for understanding the figure’s role. Having established the key, _framing_ brings back the remembered context into the present to guide a group’s collective understanding.[@thatcher2014, 3]

Comparatively few scholars within the field of Hebrew Bible have utilized Schwartz' work, although he seems to be the favorite among NT scholars (who seem more theoretically adventurous than HB scholars in this area, for whatever reason). He himself has made a few contributions to NT scholarship,[@schwartz2005a; @schwartz2005] and even has a Semeia volume specifically addressing his work.[@thatcher2014] From my perspective, Schwartz' understanding of "keys" and "frames" could be very useful tools for the study of intertextuality and inner-biblical exegesis.


## Problems
Memory Studies are not a panacea. The perceived accessibility of the language of memory (everyone knows what memories are, right?) and the ability for "memory" to gloss over difficult historical and epistemological details has lead to a number of misconceptions about Memory Studies which, in turn have produced a number of theoretically anemic studies,[@wright2014] which have elicited (well deserved, but misdirected) criticisms toward Memory Studies. Alon Confino, for example has noted that the increasing number of cursory invocations of memory may broaden the idea so far that it comes to mean nothing[@confino1997, 1387] or that it is just a cheap replacement for other fields such as "oral" or "folk" history or "myth."[@klein2011, 113] This is a question that will deserve a nuanced answer for anyone doing memory studies withe the Bible.

### A Limited Data Set
As I have already discussed, "Social Memory Theory" formally is a matter of sociological study---the study of _groups_---and yet, for those studying antiquity, we are often limited in our evidence such that we have no idea how representative a given perspective present in a text is of a particular group. Schwartz, for example, is an Americanist; much of his work has been on, for example, Abraham Lincoln. He is able to draw on a plethora of historical sources---newspapers, letters, diaries, etc.---which give not only first-hand accounts of the people contemporaneous with Lincoln, but provide a _broad_ sample of opinions. Insofar as Schwartz has compared collective memory with "public opinion," it is a major problem for historians that they are often limited to singular works with unclear provenance. Schwartz writes:

> Opinions, like memories, can only be held by individuals and can only be assessed by questioning individuals, but when these opinions are aggregated they assume new significance. [@schwartz2014, 9]

Without the ability or resources for an "aggregate" how can we meaningfully study "collective" memory?

### Social Memory as a Theory
This difficulty raises another important point about Memory Studies, namely, that each of these theories, are just that _theories_. One particularly salient critique of memory in historical discourse has been leveled by Kerwin Lee Klein, who considers the whole field as a response to the historiographical crisis brought about by post-structuralist critique and does not see it as contributing anything to history.[@klein2011, 112--137] His points are well taken, but I feel compelled to point out that Social Memory (et al.) is not a _method_ for historical enquiry; it is a theoretical framework which is meant as a heuristic for studying the way groups represent and understand their past. As it happens, a good deal of concrete evidence has confirmed the basic outlines of the way groups remember (as well as the way the brain "stores" and retrieves information),[@comanbrown2009; @markowitsch2008; @manierhirst2008] but when applied to, for example, the Bible, it does not provide _access_ to anything new, it only provides a useful frame for thinking about a limited set of interpretive problems which historians often find useful. Klein is working primarily with contemporary history, and his critique seems limited to the use of memory as a sort of replacement for scientific historiographical methods. This is not how I intend to use memory theory.

### Avenues of Growth
There are two specific aspects of Cultural Memory which I think will be worth exploring more. First, within biblical scholarship, there remains a preoccupation with the separation of "historical" and "fictional" which---while central to the historian's task in some regard---is anachronistic when applied to the way that the ancients thought about their own history. The ability for Cultural Memory to engage simultaneously "historical" traditions with "mythical" stories, I think, is an avenue worth examining more closely. Daniel Pioske observes:

> A rigorous consideration of what type of past knowledge cultural memory might constitute for the historian thus promotes and interpretive approach toward a remembered past that is able to index the malleable, transformative dimension of cultural memory that gave its stories their vitality and meaning over time in antiquity, and to perceive as well the fragile connections these memories potentially retained to certain past historical experiences.[@pioske2015, 310]

A seminal work in the area of Classics and historiography by Paul Veyne entitled _Did the Greeks Believe Their Myths_[@veyne1988] I think---coupled with a robust notion of Cultural Memory---could be an interesting place to start vis-à-vis rewritten Bible.

Second, one particularly useful metaphor for memory is that of language and language change. While some studies have observed that language can _affect_ memory,[@echterhoff2008] none, yet, that I have found have used it as an analogy to the two-dimensional shape of communicative and cultural memory. Synchronically, language provides a useful metaphor for the ability of collective memory to tolerate diversity at the periphery, while broadly maintaining a common, intelligibility at the center. Speaking specifically to the notion of social memory, we can observe that language is culturally defined; neologisms (perhaps the analogy for a new memory) are bound by phonetic, morphological, and syntactic criteria particular to the language. Diachronically, language change is the _rule_. In other words, like memory, we _expect_ language to change based on present exigencies. The notion of mnemonic etymology may be useful, particularly the ability of a word's origin to _impact_ its meaning, but with the caveat that its origin does not _determine_ its meaning.

On the whole, however, what Memory Studies really needs is time and practice---it needs its scope and purpose to be clarified, and that only comes with application. In the end, it may prove to be a fleeting trend, but for now, there seems to be ample room for experimentation, innovation, and insight. Hopefully I will be able to make some meaningful contribution to this area.
