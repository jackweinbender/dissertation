## Major positions and discourses

### George Nickelsburg (1986)[@nickelsburg_stone1984]

Nickelsburg discusses literatures which "is very closely related to the biblical texts, expanding and paraphrasing them and implicitly commenting on them" [@nickelsburg_stone1984, 89]. He suggests the the preoccupation with this particular set of texts (i.e., what would later become the bible) reflects the growing acceptance of these texts as "canon," or something similar.

Nickelsburg's article involves more than just "rewritten" texts (as the title indicates), also discussing texts which introduce wholly new material into the texts [@nickelsburg_stone1984, 89--90].

#### Rewritten Texts: 

*   1 Enoch
*   Book of Giants
*   Jubilees
*   Genesis Apocryphon
*   Biblical Antiquities
*   Books of Adam and Eve (Apocalypse of Moses, Life of Adam and Eve)
*   Hellenistic Jewish Poets

The inclusion of 1 Enoch is novel, compared to Vermes's original list, and illustrates the more expansive view that Nickelsburg has toward RwB. Furthermore, Nickelsburg also includes in his discussion a few works by hellenistic Jewish poets. These works include Philo's *On Jerusalem*, Theodotus's *On the Jews*, and the *Exagoge* by one "Ezekiel the Poet of Tragedies."

Nickelsburg traces a trajectory from smaller units of rewriting---involving short stories that deal with particular events from the biblical text---to longer, more systematic, treatments which span multiple biblical books. His treatment of 1 Enoch (which is, at least in part, the earliest text that he deals with) is illustrative of this schema. Rather than dealing with 1 Enoch as a whole, Nickelsburg addresses separately 1 Enoch 6--11, 12--16, 106--107, 65--67 and 83--84 (together), and the Book of Giants (which is not formally a part of 1 Enoch, but has a clear connection to the work). Notably, the interaction of 1 Enoch with the biblical text revolves around a single event, namely the flood and its causes (which are not identical with the biblical account). The book of Jubilees, on the other hand, covers Gen 1--Exod 14, while *LAB* covers Gen--1 Samuel (until the death of Saul), albeit with major omissions.

Because Nickelsburg does not treat these texts as a unified category of texts, he goes out of his way to investigate the purpose of each text in its historical context. While this is not unique to Nickelsburg, it serves to illustrate the benefit of *not* treating these texts as a generic unity; clearly each text had its own ends in mind when its author wrote it. 

Furthermore, the posture toward and implicit role of the biblical text is also not uniform among even the agreed upon RwB texts. Nickelsburg notes that, for example, where Jubilees's concerns are largely halakhic and makes explicit reference to the biblical text, the authority assumed by the author of Jubilees does not (at least rhetorically) originate in the exposition of the Torah, but in the "immutable heavenly tablets" [@nickelsburg_stone1984, 100--101]. Nickelsburg thus states:

>   "This process of transmitting and revising the biblical text reflects a remarkable view of Scripture and tradition. The pseudepigraphic ascription of the book to an angel of the presence and the attribution of laws to the heavenly tablets invest the author's interpretation of Scripture with absolute divine authority" [@nickelsburg_stone1984, 101].

Nickelsburg contrasts this notion of a written "second Torah" with the mishnaic notion of an oral transmission of special revelation from Sinai [@nickelsburg_stone1984, 101].

In contrast, the Genesis Apocryphon seems to have very little interest in halakhic matters. Nickelsburg writes:

>   "Different from *Jubilees* and the *Testaments*, the extant sections indicate little interest in halakhic matters or moral exhortation. Considerable notice is given to geographical details, and there is come emphasis on prayer. The author's treatment of his characters is marked by a sensitivity to the emotions and reactions that reflect their humanity" [@nickelsburg_stone1984, 106]

Finally, he observes that *LAB* likewise differs with Jubilees in its omission of halakhic matters and its "highly selective reproduction of the text" [@nickelsburg_stone1984, 110]. This selectivity also differs from the Genesis Apocryphon, which otherwise is "characterized by the addition of lengthy non-biblical incidence" [@nickelsburg_stone1984, 110]. 

### Harrington (1986)[@harrington_kraft-nickelsburg1986]

Harrington adopts the term "rewritten bible" 

>   "simply to refer to those products of Palestinian Judaism at the turn of the era that take as their literary framework the flow of the biblical text itself and apparently have as their major purpose the clarification and actualization of the biblical story [@harrington_kraft-nickelsburg1986, 239].

He constructs a slightly expanded list of texts, including:

* Jubilees
* Assumption of Moses
* 11QTemple (Temple Scroll)
* GenApoc
* Ps. Philo's *Biblical Antiquities*
* Josephus's *Jewish Antiquities*

He also makes a point to suggest that a number of other texts may be able to be included in the list, including *Paraleipomena of Jeremiah*, *Life of Adam and Eve/Apocalypse of Moses*, and *Ascension of Isaiah*. He also includes the novel criterion that the works should derive from Palestinian Judaism, although he concedes that this is artificial. As an aside, he notes that this distinction is rooted in Cross' local text hypothesis. Since this is no longer *au courant*, it's probably not worth perusing. He does, however, make a very nice observation which will bolster my basic thesis, stating:

>   "What holds all of them [RwB texts] together is the effort to actualize a religious tradition and make it meaningful within new situations" [@harrington_kraft-nickelsburg1986, 239-40]

Harrington's major break from Vermes comes in his rejection of RwB as a category or literary genre in favor of a process-oriented approach. He states:

>   Nevertheless, establishing that these books are not appropriately described as targums or midrashim is not the same as proving that they all represent a distinctive literary genre called "rewritten Bible." In fact, it seems better to view rewriting the Bible as a kind of activity or process than to see it as a distinctive literary genre of Palestinian Judaism" [@harrington_kraft-nickelsburg1986, 242--243]

In this respect, Harrington takes a broad view of rewriting and allows, to some degree, that this process be understood similar to a reception history (although, this is my term, and not his). Instead, he observes that while texts such as Jubilees and *Assumption of Moses* both constitute a rewriting of the Bible, both "are formally revelations of apocalypses" [@harrington_kraft-nickelsburg1986, 243]. In other words, a single *genre*---insofar as the word describes a literary *form*---is not sufficient to subsume the varied *forms* (read: apocalypse, history, testament, etc.) which all can be described as "rewritten."

Harrington suggests that the intention of each work ought to be evaluated independently.

### Alexander (1988)[@alexander_carson-williamson1988]

Alexander's goal is to examine the use of the biblical text within the so-called RwB texts to determine whether they form a distinct genre and whether there exists a set of concrete criteria by which scholars can admit or exclude texts from the category [@alexander_carson-williamson1988, 99].

>   "We shall focus attention on four works normally included in the genre (Jubilees, Genesis Apocryphon, the *Liber Antiquitatum Biblicarum*, and Josephus' *Jewish Antiquities*), and analyse these with respect to their form, their attitude towards the authority of the Bible, their use of biblical and non-biblical material, and their exegetical methods." [@alexander_carson-williamson1988, 99--100]

Through a series of four case studies (Jubilees, Genesis Apocryphon, *Liber Antiquitatum Biblicarum*, and Josephus's *Jewish Antiquities*) Alexander determines that does form a distinct literary genre and sets out nine "principal characteristics" of RwB:

1.  They are *narratives* which follow the order of the biblical text. He broadly refers to the texts as "histories" (as distinct from theological treatise).

2. They are "free standing" literary works that take on the same form as the text that they rewrite. As such, they do not "comment" on the text explicitly, but weave a seamless retelling of the biblical story.

3. They are not meant to replace the biblical work.

4. They cover a great deal of biblical narrative. Here he also notes that certain works which are primarily "expansive" (the Book of Giants, the Book of Noah) probably should not count because their relationship to the biblical text is "centrifugal," while properly RwB texts are "centripetal" to the biblical text.

    >   "Rewritten Bible texts are centripetal: they come back to the Bible again and again. The rewritten Bible texts make use of the legendary material, but by placing that material within an extended biblical narrative (in association with passages of more or less literal retelling of the Bible), they clamp the legends firmly to the biblical framework, and reintegrate them into the biblical history." [@alexander_carson-williamson1988, 117]

5. They follow the biblical text's narrative order, but do not, necessarily include everything. They are "highly selective in what they represent"[@alexander_carson-williamson1988, 117], but do not omit so much that the integrity of the biblical account is compromised. He notes "A proper balance between the 'literal' and the 'non-literal' sections is probably of fundamental importance to the genre" [@alexander_carson-williamson1988, 117].

6. They offer an interpretive reading of Scripture which (quoting Vermes) offer "a fuller, smoother and doctrinally more advanced form of the sacred narrative" [@alexander_carson-williamson1988, 117; citing @schurer1986, 305] and constitute " a kind of commentary" [@alexander_carson-williamson1988, 117] which is indirect and whose "full significance can only be grasped if the original is borne constantly in mind" [@alexander_carson-williamson1988, 117].

7. They are limited by their particular (narrative) form and are only able to offer a single interpretation of the rewritten text. Alexander contrasts this with those of the Rabbis and Philo who are each able to offer multiple interpretations of the a single text, and thus, "treat the underlying text as polyvalent" [@alexander_carson-williamson1988, 117].

8. They are further limited by their form which does not allow them to explain their exegetical reasoning. 

    >   "The methods by which they solve the problems of the original are essentially midrashic, i.e. similar to those found in the rabbinic midrashim. But unlike the midrashim (or Philo) they cannot make explicit their midrashic working. "[@alexander_carson-williamson1988, 118]

9. They incorporate material which is not exegetically derived from the biblical text---such as oral tradition, legends, etc.---and fuse it with the rewritten text: 

    >    "aiming at a synthesis of the whole tradition (both biblical and extra-biblical) within a biblical framework: they seek to unify the tradition on a biblical base." [@alexander_carson-williamson1988, 118]




## Emmanuel Tov (1998)[@tov_dsd1998; @tov_krarrer-kraus2008]

<!--Rewritten Bible Compositions and Biblical Manuscripts, with Special Attention to the Samaritan Pentateuch-->

Tov's purpose is to specify the "fine line between biblical manuscripts and rewritten Bible texts" [@tov_dsd1998, 334]. By this, Tov means that he is concerned with what I'm calling the "lower bound" of the definition of RwB, specifically, the distinction between a text *edition* and a distinct composition, which Tov considers "rewritten." The primary difference between these two categories of texts, according to Tov, is not how dramatically the daughter text diverges from its parent, but the *purpose* of the daughter text [@tov_dsd1998, 334]. According to Tov, this purpose is mirrored in the putatively authoritative status of the "biblical" text vis-a-vis the rewritten text which, he says, is not authoritative (although, he seems to suggest that this is up for debate[@tov_dsd1998, 337]).

For example, he notes that the extant texts of Jeremiah, while widely divergent in length and order, still represent "biblical Jeremiah" which carries some authoritative weight, though Tov is careful to point out that the nature of this authority is not clear and "the boundary between the biblical and non-biblical texts was probably not as fixed as we would have liked for the purpose of our scholarly analysis" [@tov_dsd1998, 335]. 

Tov doesn't really contribute all that much to the definition of the category, though he seems less preoccupied with a precise definition. In fact, after reading Tov, I'm now more in agreement with Bernstein that Tov's working definition is almost meaningless. It seems that if we include the SP under the rubric of RwB, then we ought to include the LXX and Targums, et al., and, indeed, I would agree with Bernstein that such a category is bordering on useless—really he's just talking about textual transmission, which RwB is, indeed, a part of.



## Moshe Bernstein (2005)[@bernstein_textus2005]

<!--Rewritten Bible: A Generic Category Which Has Outlived Its Usefulness?-->


For lack of a better term, Bernstein is a Vermesian conservative; he wants to maintain Vermes' narrow use of the term for fear of it losing its usefulness as a category. Notably, Bernstein never (as far as I'm concerned) clearly articulates what it means for a category to be "useful." All the same, he sets out to:

> "examine the definition and descriptions of "rewritten Bible" proffered by Vermes and several subsequent scholars, in order to delineate the variety of ways in which the term is currently employed and to make some suggestions for how we might use it more clearly and definitively in the future." [@bernstein_textus2005, 171--172]

Bernstein begins by addressing the few small modifications that he makes to Vermes' list, namely that Bernstein does not understand the Targums to be examples of RwB. He excludes Targums from his discussion "*ab initio*," as well as "biblical" books, by which he seems to mean "Chronicles." Despite this second exclusion, Bernstein acknowledges that "One group's rewritten Bible could very well be another's biblical text!" [@bernstein_textus2005, 175]. This seems particularly odd, since, and Ethiopian Christian may protest that Jubilees should be excluded as well. Bernstein concedes that "matters of canon and audience may play a role," but doesn't address the topic further. 

Bernstein critiques scholars such as Nicklesburg[@], Harrington[@], and Brooke[@] for excessively expanding the use of the term RwB at its "upper bound" (my term) to the point that they have weakened the term and have "not aided in focusing scholarly attention on the unifying vs. divergent traits of some of these early interpretive works" [@bernstein_textus2005, 179]. Likewise, Bernstein critiques Tov for including reworked texts (e.g., 4QRP) and therefor expanding the "lower bound" of the category. While Bernstein  avers that "Rearrangement with the goal of interpretation is probably an earlier stage in the development of biblical 'commentary' than supplementation with the goal of interpretation," he nevertheless distinguishes the former from the category RwB and declares that "the definitions of 'rewritten Bible' furnished by Tov and Vermes are [not] even remotely compatible, and we need to choose between them simply for the purposes of clarity" [@bernstein_textus2005, 185].

Bernstein, ultimately, argues that Vermes' category is worth keeping around, and admonishes the reader to maintain a narrow definition of the category, because, in his own words, "the more specific the implications of the term, the more valuable it is as a measuring device" [@bernstein_textus2005, 195], and conversely that "the loser the definition, the less precisely it classifies those items under its rubric" [@bernstein_textus2005, 195]. While his statement is true—almost axiomatically so—I am still left wondering what Bernstein sees as "at stake." In other words, "classification for *what?*" In what way should RwB texts (according to Bernstein's definition) be treated differently than, say, 1 Enoch? If we are not claiming that RwB was an acnient category, and we do not treat these texts differently than other, similar ancient texts (other than defining them as such), what value has been added? It seems to me that a process oriented definition, such as that of Harrington and Nickelsburg, is much more interesting and useful for describing and understanding ancient texts.


## Michael Segal (2005)[@segal_henze2005]
<!--Between Bible and Rewritten Bible-->

Segal seeks to enumerate a series of criteria by which scholars can distinguish between editions of biblical texts and so-called rewritten texts. He introduces a number of difficulties with making the distinction, not least among them is the relative fluidity of the biblical text(s) during the late second temple period. Broadly speaking, his goal is to delimit the "lower" boundary of the RwB phenomenon. That is to say, he wants to focus on the line between text edition, and new composition, rather than on the upper, or outer bound which defines, for example what is RwB and what is parabiblical (to use a later, poorly defined term).

Segal's understanding of the role of RwB is rooted in the conviction that:

>   "The dependence upon biblical compositions in the process of creating new works is a product of the author's desire to impute authority to his work; by associating his composition with the holiest of texts, the new work is also granted the same stamp of authority" [@segal_henze2005, 11]

And further:

>   "the inclusion of this material within the framework of the biblical passages under interpretation transforms the ideas of the later writer into authoritative and accepted beliefs.... Even though these rewritten compositions sometimes contain material contradictory to their biblical sources, their inclusion within the existing framework of the biblical text bestows upon them legitimacy in the eyes of the intended audience" [@segal_henze2005, 11]

And finally:

>   "The nature of the relationship between rewritten biblical compositions and their sources constitutes a paradox. On the one hand, the rewritten composition relies upon biblical texts for authority and legitimacy. The author claims that any new information included in the later work already appears in earlier sources. But simultaneously, the insertion of new ideas into the biblical text, ideas that may even contradict the beliefs and concepts of the original biblical authors, undermines the very authority that the rewriter hopes to utilize" [@segal_henze2005, 11-12]

Segal's treatment of textual fluidity in the 2nd temple period is worth looking at, but for our purposes, it's not terribly relevant. Instead, I will focus on the characteristics of literature that he considers RwB vis-a-vis textual editions. He breaks up his criteria into "external" and "literary" (read: internal) characteristics.

### External Characteristics

 Segal's external characteristics are by far his weakest. He notes two external characteristics of RwB texts: "language" and "relationship between the source and its revision." 

#### Language

He doesn't mount much of an argument for language being categorically decisive, simply stating:

>   "On the simplest level, one can posit that any composition which presumes to present a copy of its source will be composed in the same language as its *Vorlage.* Thus, for most of the Bible, this limits the discussion to rewritten texts written in Hebrew." [@segal_henze2005, 17]

Yet, by this criteria, he is able to excludes Josephus's *Antiquities* as well as the Genesis Apocryphon categorically, because they were not composed in Hebrew. He states:

>   "Although each of these works resembles other rewritten compositions from a literary perspective, the difference in language demarcates a clear line between them and their source" [@segal_henze2005, 17--18]

I think Segal is needlessly undercutting himself here, unless he just doesn't want to deal with these "non Hebrew" texts. One might wonder that if a single criterion categorically excludes several texts which meet all the other criteria, perhaps the problem is with the criterion. In his discussions of other criteria, he begins by giving the principle by which the "edition" would assert itself as equal to its *Vorlage*, then contrast that with the RwB (see, esp. Expansion v. Abridgment). His reasoning is sound for a text edition (although I think the issue of textual authority and *translation* is, perhaps, too hastily ignored in this case), and could easily be contrasted with, for example the Genesis Apocryphon, which meets nearly all of his internal criteria.

#### The Textual Relationship between the Source and Its Revision,

His second characteristic [@segal_henze2005, 18--19] is "the textual relationship between the Source and Its Revision," which is just a convoluted way of saying that you have to be able to "see" the *Vorlage* in the rewritten text. He uses the book of Chronicles as the parade example of this relationship and notes the caveats necessary in dealing with *Vorlagen* from this period (i.e., fluid texts == difficult to say what is 'rewritten' v. just another variant in the *Vorlage*).

Segal notes that both of these criteria, in fact, apply to textual editions, as well as to RwB texts [@segal_henze2005, 20]. In other words, these are not "distinguishing" criteria, so much as the baseline for consideration. Again, I think the language criterion is flawed and unnecessary.

### Literary Criteria for "Rewritten Bible"

It is the "Literary Criteria" which Segal, ultimately, argues that provide the *definition* of RwB texts. He writes:

>   "It is precisely these characteristics, I submit, that define a rewritten composition as a new work and not merely as a further literary edition of the source" [@segal_henze2005, 20].

Here again, Segal emphasizes that he is not identifying the *whole* scope of RwB, but is only concerned with what I've termed the "lower bound." Segal provides six criteria:

#### Scope of the Composition

Segal observes that "editions" (i.e. non-rewritten) of texts cover the same material as their source. In other words, one expects an edition of Genesis to cover the same material as the book of Genesis; pluses and minuses do not stray  into other works.

On the other hand, rewritten texts "do not generally correspond to the scope of their sources" [@segal_henze2005, 20]. He writes:

>   "Chronicles presents parts of Samuel and Kings ; Jubilees rewrites Genesis--Exod 12; Pseudo-Philo's *Biblical Antiquities* begins with Adam and continues through David, but seems to be most interested in the period of the Judges. None of these works corresponds to any one biblical book, nor to any collection of works. ... In all these examples the change in the scope of the composition created a new literary unit." [@segal_henze2005, 20--21]

#### New Narrative frame

Several of the RwB texts include a framing narrative. Segal writes, 

>   "This change places the composition as a while into a new setting and thus offers a new ideological framework by which to understand the text" [@segal_henze2005, 21].

His examples include the Temple Scroll and Jubilees, both of which re-frame the "biblical" material. In the case of both works, the Torah is assumed and the new work presumed to be a reflection of a second, direct revelation of the law to Moses, albeit by different means (and fragmentary, in the case of the Temple Scroll). In Jubilees, the angel of the Presence revealed this "second Torah" during Moses' second ascent (Exod 24). On the other hand, the Temple scroll seems to have begun in Exod 34 [@segal_henze2005, 22]. Both of these "additional" revelations are, therefore, rooted, according to Segal, in the biblical text. Thus, Segal makes the observation here that 

>   "at the same time, the author appeals to the authority of the Torah as it provides the evidence for this revelation" [@segal_henze2005, 22]

#### Voice

While biblical narratives are generally written in a "detached" third person style, Segal observes that both Jubilees and the Temple Scroll "change the voice of the narrator throughout" [@segal_henze2005, 22]. As far as I can tell, what Segal means is that in these RwB texts,  certain evens which are narrated in the third person in the biblical text are re-framed as, for instance, direct discourse in the first person by an angel, or even by God. This may seem like a minor quibble, but the "narrator" has a distinct and technical meaning in narrative criticism which should be maintained. I would note, however, that this sort of reframing is not unique to RwB, since, e.g., Deut does something similar. This is a weak criteria, in my mind.

#### Expansion versus Abridgment

Segal makes the observation that by-and-large, text editions are *additive*. That is to say, when there is a discrepancy between the amount of content (as opposed to the order), typically the shorter text is considered older. Segal is here concerned with editorial changes, and not with scribal errors, which, of course could go in both directions (through parablepsis et al.). This property, he contends, is rooted in the conviction of the scribes that in order to reproduce a text, one must reproduce the *entire* text. Segal writes:

>   "Once a scribe removed material, he could no longer claim he was preserving the same composition, because one can no longer identify the source within the revision" [@segal_henze2005, 24]

Rewritten bible texts, however, felt free to add *or remove* material because they understood themselves to be composing an entirely new work. he writes:

>   "By definition, after a reviser has abridged, deleted, or disregarded entire sections, his new composition no longer contains the biblical source he reworked. In contrast to another edition of the same composition, a scribe who reduces his source makes no pretense of producing a text identified with or equal to it" [@segal_henze2005, 24]

I find this to be an interesting criterion, but I wonder whether it may be importing too much from later conceptions of "the text." Furthermore, it seems like quite a statement to say that *all* ancient editions were *only* editorially expansive; there are far too little evidence in this article to sustain this position, even if it may be true.

#### Tendentious Editorial Layer

In differing editions of a text, according to Segal:

>   "The two editions of the same biblical composition do not change the basic ideological framework of the book" [@segal_henze2005, 25]

Thus, differing editions of, say, Jeremiah may differ---even evince certain "tendencies" but those do not change the fundamental ideology of the work. Likewise, expansion and addition to the work (e.g. additions to Daniel) are in line with the theological *Tendenz* of the shorter book. On the other hand, regarding RwB texts, Segal writes:

>   "it is possible in almost every case to identify and describe the fundamental beliefs and concepts of the rewritten works. In many cases, these beliefs differ from those found in the biblical source undergoing revision" [@segal_henze2005, 25]

#### Explicit References to the Source Composition

Finally, Segal notes that a work's allusion to its source text *by definition* sets apart. Conversely, a text edition *cannot* reference itself as a different text, obviously.

## Other Thoughts

Segal offers a good starting point, but a number of his criteria/characteristics require more thinking. One category of literature which I would have liked him to address is that of translations. Not only are translations a) by definition in a different language (cf. external factors), but they may evince b) a "tendentious editorial layer" (Esther) and c) explicit references to the source text (cf. Prologue to Sirach), as well .
