3. My move:
    * Limits of current discussion
        - Generic classification still lacks something (Category theory?)
        - Role of genre for reading strategy
        - What does genre tell us about a text, if not "how" to read it?
    * All of these still presuppose a *text* that is re*written* and thus focus on the relationship of these RwB texts to particular antecedents
    * Need for different model
