## Outline

1. Vermes and RwB [@vermes1961; vermes:2014]
    * Context and goals
    * Texts
    * Main argument vis-a-vis 2nd temple lit
2. Major positions and discourses
    * Harrington [@harrington1986]
    * Crawford 
    * Tov
    * Fitzmyer
    * Bernstein
    * Segal
    * Machiela
    * Zahn
    * Campbell
3. My move:
    * Limits of current discussion
        - Generic classification still lacks something (Category theory?)
        - Role of genre for reading strategy
        - What does genre tell us about a text, if not "how" to read it?
    * All of these still presuppose a *text* that is re*written* and thus focus on the relationship of these RwB texts to particular antecedents
    * Need for different model
