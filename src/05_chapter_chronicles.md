<!--Throughout this chapter I will refer to "the Chronicler" to refer simply to the the author or authors who are responsible for the book of Chronicles and not, as others have used the term, to refer to the common author of Chronicles, Ezra and Nehemiah.-->

Scholars of the Hebrew Bible have long observed that the book of Chronicles is a derivative work of Samuel--Kings which reflects the concerns and religious sensibilities of the late Persian or Early Hellenistic Periods. For example, in his classic work on the history of ancient Israel, Wellhausen begins his treatment of the history of traditions within Judaism with a lengthy discussion of Chronicles which, he observes,  differs from the history of Israel portrayed in Samuel--Kings due to the chronological distance of the works and the intervention of the Priestly Code into the theology of  ~2T Judaism.[@wellhausen1957, 171--172] Chronicles, according to Wellhausen, provides a clear example of the way that ancient Israel's traditions evolved over time. Just as the legal material of the Hexateuch developed over the centuries, so too the traditions of the historical books were subject to the changing theologies of later centuries. While the particulars of the relationship of Samuel--Kings to Chronicles and the nuances of Priestly influences on the Hebrew Bible remain subject to scholarly debate, the broad consensus remains that Chronicles was written sometime in the late Persian or early Hellenistic periods, heavily utilizing Samuel--Kings as a literary source, and bearing an ideological *Tendenz* influenced by (though not identical to) the final layers of the Pentateuch.[For a thorough and reasonably recent summary of the *status questionis*, see @knoppers2003, 72--89; See also @japhet1993; @japhet2009; @braun1986; and @coggins1976] 

The scholarly discourse surrounding the formation of the Hebrew Bible has increasingly turned to memory studies as a robust framework for describing the processes by which the biblical traditions were produced and transmitted.[@wright2014; @blenkinsopp2013; @rogerson2010; @davies2008; @hendel2005;  @smith_cbq2002] And, it is for the same reasons that Wellhausen chose to begin his treatment of the history of traditions with Chronicles, namely, the relative security with which scholars have dated Samuel--Kings and the major Pentateuchal strata~vis-a-vis Chronicles, that the work has likewise played an important role as memory studies has become an increasingly influential lens tough which to view the biblical traditions.[@benzvi_st2017; @benzvi-a_evans-williams2013; @benzvi-b_evans-williams2013] Thus, while Chronicles is not the *latest* book in the Hebrew Bible, it is uniquely situated at the end of the traditioning process preserved in the Hebrew Bible. In some ways, therefore, Chronicles gets the last word on a certain set of traditions surrounding the monarchic period, in particular those of David, Solomon, and the kings of Judah.

Although it is broadly agreed upon that Chronicles exhibits a hypertextual[@genette1997, 5] relationship to Samuel--Kings, treating Chronicles as an exemplar of ~rwb is somewhat less common.[Though, not particularly *un*common: @campbell_zsengeller2014; @zahn_lim-collins2010; @bernstein_textus2005; Alexander considers Chronicles to be a "prototype" of ~rwb, see @alexander_carson-williamson1988, 100] The ambivalence of scholars towards treating Chronicles as ~rwb is rooted, unsurprisingly, in the confusion surrounding the definition of the term (see Chapter 1). Knoppers, for example, takes special care to treat the question of whether Chronicles should be understood as ~rwb in the introduction of his commentary and notes, from the very beginning, that he will answer the question based on what he understands to be the essential elements of ~rwb.[@knoppers2003 , 129--134] He writes:

> They [~rwb] select from, interpret, comment on , and expand protions of a particular biblical book (or group of books), addressing obscurities, contradictions, and other percieved problems with the source text. Rewritten Bible texts normally emulate the form of the source text and follow it sequentially. The major intention of such works seems to be to provide a coherant interpretive reading of the biblical text.[@knoppers2003, 130]

Knoppers observes that, while Chronicles exhibits most of the specific literary moves  which ~rwb is known for (expanding, harmonizing, etc. its *Vorlage*), the presence of material which is entirely unique to Chronicles, cannot be attributed to a purely exegetical or explanatory impulse. In addition to the narrative additions within Chronicles, the genealogies of Chr 1--9 have no corollary in Samuel--Kings, and can hardly be considered a rewritten form of the Penatateuch.[@knoppers2003, 132] Thus, while Knoppers affirms that certain portions of Chronicles "may be profitably compared with a number of rewritten Bible texts,"[@knoppers2003, 131] ultimately he concludes that Chronicles "is more than a paraphrase or literary elaboration of the primary history"[@knoppers2003, 134] and thus ~rwb cannot can account for Chronicles as a whole instead suggesting that it should be treated as its own work.[@knoppers2003, 131--134]

While Knoppers' assessment is fair given the definition that he supplies for ~rwb, I have adopted a broader definition of ~rwb that accommodates for Knoppers' reservations. In fact, the rationale for why ~rwb cannot account for the complexity of the whole book of Chronicles, according to Knoppers, is the same basic argument that I have made for why an *exegetically* focused definition of ~rwb is insufficient to account for the complexity even of the literature that scholars *traditionally* consider to be ~rwb. Knoppers' criticisms, therefore, could just as easily be applied to Josephus' ~ant or to ~jub (or, I would argue, even to ~ga) and why I have suggested that memory studies may provide a useful model for discussing ~rwb.

This chapter will focus on the ways that social and cultural memory theory can be used to explain the processes through which Chronicles emended, harmonized, augmented, and omitted traditions in Samuel--Kings and the way that those traditions shaped and were shaped by the social location of their author(s). In particular, I will focus on the mnemonic site of the Temple in Jerusalem and the discourse around its foundation. << CLARIFY THIS WHEN YOU FINISH THE CHAPTER. 

## David's Census and Araunah/Ornan's Threshing Floor

The account of David's census in 2 Samuel and its hypertext in 1 Chronicles provides a clear example of the way that present ideologies play a significant role in the reception of cultural memory by a society and its (re)construction in the social memory. Both 2 Samuel 24 and 1 Chronicles 21 recount the story of David's census, the punishment that Yahweh inflicts on David for doing so, and David's penitential offerings at the threshing floor of Araunah/Ornan. 

The narrative in 2 Sam 24 begins by stating that Yahweh had become angry with Israel and "incited David against them" (*wayyāseṯ ʾeṯ-dāwiḏ bāhem*). David orders the census and is stricken with guilt (it is not clear why David, apparently, was not supposed to do this). Yahweh offers him a choice through the prophet Gad between three years of famine, three months of pursuit, or three days of pestilence. David consents to the pestilence, and, after seeing its destructive force in the form of an angel, pleads with Yahweh to punish him personally, and not to continue harming the people. The prophet Gad instructs David to make offerings to Yahweh where he saw the angel, at the threshing floor of Araunah,  the Jebusite. David purchases the threshing floor and Araunah's livestock, builds an altar to Yahweh, and makes his offerings.



moriah = here and Gen 22

 Modern readers of 2 Samuel are understandably perplexed by its narrative logic. Yahweh becomes angry, prompts David to do something bad, then punishes the people for David's mistake---a sort of divine entrapment. It is no wonder, then, that we see a different explanation for David's actions within Chronicles. The account in 1 Chron 21 follows closely that of 2 Sam 24, with one notable exception, it is Satan (or, possibly 'an adversary') who incites David against Israel: *wayyaʕămoḏ śāṭān ʕal-yiśrāʔēl wayyāseṯ ʔeṯ-dāwîd limnôṯ ʔeṯ yiśrāʔēl* "Satan stood up against Israel and incited David to count Israel." The results are, for our purposes, the same: Yahweh becomes angry with David who bears the guilt for the census and Yahweh's death-angel kills some seventy-thousand people.

It is not clear what the author of Chronicles had in mind when using the term *śāṭān*. It is commonly held that in this case the author *was* in fact using the term as a proper name in reference to a particular, malevolent spirit, "Satan" who functions as a sort of precursor to the more developed "Satan" of post-biblical and New Testament theologies [@rollston_keith-stuckenbruck2016, 4--5]. This figure is to be distinguished from other "satans" in the Hebrew Bible, found in Job and Zechariah, due to its lack of definite article. Proper names, in Hebrew, do not take the definite article, therefore, those references in Job and Zechariah must not be proper names. However, there is not a scholarly consensus on this matter, and several scholars have, in fact, argued the exact opposite, citing the fact that article may be used "when terms applying to whole classes are restricted (simply by useage) to particular individuals ... or things." [@geseniuskautzsch1910, §126d; as argued by @japhet2009, 115] In such a case, *śāṭān* should simply be understood as an indefinite noun, "an accuser" and may be understood as a human antagonist of David [@stokes_jbl2009; @japhet2009, 114--117; @japhet1993, 370--390].

Regardless of how one understands *śāṭān* to be functioning, it is clear that the author of Chronicles understands the mechanisms at work---whether supernatural or interpersonal---differently than the author of 2 Sam 24. As Japhet notes, Chronicles shifts the incitement away from Yahweh and removes any reference to the deity's anger prior to the census. The result is that the problematic "entrapment" of David no longer exists and Yahweh no longer seems so "mercurial" [@rollston_keith-stuckenbruck2016, 4]. Whatever the specific point of contention the author of 1 Chronicles had with 2 Sam 24, his theological toolbox was conspicuously different than the author of 2 Sam. Whether that toolbox was more restrictive (*śāṭān* as a person) or more expansive (*śāṭān* as a celestial being) is a matter of interpretation.

As a process of memory, we can see that a theological shift---whatever it may have been---meant that the same set of actions and consequences required a different explanation than the original context. Therefore, I understand Chronicle's account of David's census to be an example of a theological reanalysis of the tradition preserved in 2 Samuel. Yahweh's actions as described in 2 Samuel were non-sensical in what one might call the "grammar" of the Chronicler's theology. The narrative required another active agent whom could instigate David's actions in order that Yahweh could punish the Israelites. The Chronicler used *śāṭān* as the malevolent actor to achieve his narrative goals.
