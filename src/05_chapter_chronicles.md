<!--Throughout this chapter I will refer to "the Chronicler" to refer simply to the the author or authors who are responsible for the book of Chronicles and not, as others have used the term, to refer to the common author of Chronicles, Ezra and Nehemiah.-->

Scholars of the Hebrew Bible have long observed that the book of Chronicles is a derivative work of Samuel--Kings which reflects the concerns and religious sensibilities of the late Persian or Early Hellenistic Periods. For example, in his classic work on the history of ancient Israel, Wellhausen begins his treatment of the history of traditions within Judaism with a lengthy discussion of Chronicles which, he observes,  differs from the history of Israel portrayed in Samuel--Kings due to the chronological distance of the works and the intervention of the Priestly Code into the theology of  ~2T Judaism.[@wellhausen1957, 171--172] Chronicles, according to Wellhausen, provides a clear example of the way that ancient Israel's traditions evolved over time. Just as the legal material of the Hexateuch developed over the centuries, so too the traditions of the historical books were subject to the changing theologies of later centuries. While the particulars of the relationship of Samuel--Kings to Chronicles and the nuances of Priestly influences on the Hebrew Bible remain subject to scholarly debate, the broad consensus remains that Chronicles was written sometime in the late Persian or early Hellenistic periods, heavily utilizing Samuel--Kings as a literary source, and bearing an ideological *Tendenz* influenced by (though not identical to) the final layers of the Pentateuch.[For a thorough and reasonably recent summary of the *status questionis*, see @knoppers2003, 72--89; See also @japhet1993; @japhet2009; @braun1986; and @coggins1976] 

The scholarly discourse surrounding the formation of the Hebrew Bible has increasingly turned to memory studies as a robust framework for describing the processes by which the biblical traditions were produced and transmitted.[@wright2014; @blenkinsopp2013; @rogerson2010; @davies2008; @hendel2005;  @smith_cbq2002] And, it is for the same reasons that Wellhausen chose to begin his treatment of the history of traditions with Chronicles, namely, the relative security with which scholars have dated Samuel--Kings and the major Pentateuchal strata~vis-a-vis Chronicles, that the work has likewise played an important role as memory studies has become an increasingly influential lens tough which to view the biblical traditions.[@benzvi_st2017; @benzvi-a_evans-williams2013; @benzvi-b_evans-williams2013] Thus, while Chronicles is not the *latest* book in the Hebrew Bible, it is uniquely situated at the end of the traditioning process preserved in the Hebrew Bible. In some ways, therefore, Chronicles gets the last word on a certain set of traditions surrounding the monarchic period, in particular those of David, Solomon, and the kings of Judah.

Although it is broadly agreed upon that Chronicles exhibits a hypertextual[@genette1997, 5] relationship to Samuel--Kings, treating Chronicles as an exemplar of ~rwb is somewhat less common.[Though, not particularly *un*common: @campbell_zsengeller2014; @zahn_lim-collins2010; @bernstein_textus2005; Alexander considers Chronicles to be a "prototype" of ~rwb, see @alexander_carson-williamson1988, 100] The ambivalence of scholars towards treating Chronicles as ~rwb is rooted, unsurprisingly, in the confusion surrounding the definition of the term (see Chapter 1). Knoppers, for example, takes special care to treat the question of whether Chronicles should be understood as ~rwb in the introduction of his commentary and notes, from the very beginning, that he will answer the question based on what he understands to be the essential elements of ~rwb.[@knoppers2003 , 129--134] He writes:

> They [~rwb] select from, interpret, comment on , and expand protions of a particular biblical book (or group of books), addressing obscurities, contradictions, and other percieved problems with the source text. Rewritten Bible texts normally emulate the form of the source text and follow it sequentially. The major intention of such works seems to be to provide a coherant interpretive reading of the biblical text.[@knoppers2003, 130]

Knoppers observes that, while Chronicles exhibits most of the specific literary moves  which ~rwb is known for (expanding, harmonizing, etc. its *Vorlage*), the presence of material which is entirely unique to Chronicles, cannot be attributed to a purely exegetical or explanatory impulse. In addition to the narrative additions within Chronicles, the genealogies of Chr 1--9 have no corollary in Samuel--Kings, and can hardly be considered a rewritten form of the Penatateuch.[@knoppers2003, 132] Thus, while Knoppers affirms that certain portions of Chronicles "may be profitably compared with a number of rewritten Bible texts,"[@knoppers2003, 131] ultimately he concludes that Chronicles "is more than a paraphrase or literary elaboration of the primary history"[@knoppers2003, 134] and thus ~rwb cannot can account for Chronicles as a whole instead suggesting that it should be treated as its own work.[@knoppers2003, 131--134]

While Knoppers' assessment is fair given the definition that he supplies for ~rwb, I have adopted a broader definition of ~rwb that accommodates for Knoppers' reservations. In fact, the rationale for why ~rwb cannot account for the complexity of the whole book of Chronicles, according to Knoppers, is the same basic argument that I have made for why an *exegetically* focused definition of ~rwb is insufficient to account for the complexity even of the literature that scholars *traditionally* consider to be ~rwb. Knoppers' criticisms, therefore, could just as easily be applied to Josephus' ~ant or to ~jub (or, I would argue, even to ~ga) and why I have suggested that memory studies may provide a useful model for discussing ~rwb.

This chapter will focus on the ways that social and cultural memory theory can be used to explain the processes through which Chronicles emended, harmonized, augmented, and omitted traditions in Samuel--Kings and the way that those traditions shaped and were shaped by the social location of their author(s). In particular, I will focus on the mnemonic site of the Temple in Jerusalem and the discourse around its foundation. << CLARIFY THIS WHEN YOU FINISH THE CHAPTER. 

## David's Census and Araunah/Ornan's Threshing Floor

The account of David's census in 2 Samuel and its hypertext in 1 Chronicles provides a clear example of the way that present ideologies play a significant role in the reception of cultural memory by a society and its (re)construction in the social memory. Both 2 Samuel 24 and 1 Chronicles 21 recount the story of David's census, the punishment that Yahweh inflicts on David for doing so, and David's penitential offerings at the threshing floor of Araunah/Ornan. << More here. Perhaps talk about "Nodes" >>

### 2 Samuel 24

The narrative in 2 Sam 24 begins by stating that Yahweh had become angry with Israel and "incited David against them" (*wayyāseṯ ʾeṯ-dāwiḏ bāhem*). David orders the census and is stricken with guilt (it is not clear in the text why this was a bad thing). Yahweh offers him a choice through the prophet Gad between three years of famine, three months of pursuit, or three days of pestilence. David consents to the pestilence, and, after seeing its destructive force in the form of an angel, pleads with Yahweh to punish him personally, and not to continue harming the people. The prophet Gad instructs David to make offerings to Yahweh where he saw the angel, at the threshing floor of Araunah,  the Jebusite. David purchases the threshing floor and Araunah's livestock, builds an altar to Yahweh, and makes his offerings.

The purpose of this pericope within Samuel is not clear and its ostensible connection to 2 Sam 21:1--14 is merely thematic.[@mccarter1984, 509] The internal logic of the narrative is no less problematic: the text offer no explanation for Yahweh's anger, nor does it explain the connection between the census and the pestilence. While Yahweh's initial anger can be accounted for theologically (gods do not need reasons to be angry), the connection between the census and the pestilence seems to be built on some tacit correlation between the two. McCarter, following a number of earlier studies, for example, has suggested that the danger in taking a census is found in the connection of between the census and the ritual failure. Drawing comparisons to Num 1:2--3 and Exod 30:11--14, McCarter notes that censuses in the ancient world were generally performed for military purposes (Num 1:2--3) or to levy funds (Exod 30:11--14). Since the purpose of David's census seems to be a measurement of military might, it likely would have involved enrolling fighting-aged men in the military (Cf. Num 1:2--3), thereby forcing those enrolled to remain ritual purity in accordance with military standards. The likelihood that not all of the soldiery would be able to maintain this level of purity would have been high and may have been thought to invite divine retribution. On the other hand, while the census instructions in Exod 30:11--14 were not for the purposes of the military, they did require that each person "give a ransom for his life to Yahweh" (*nāṯənû ʾı̂š kōp̄er nap̄šô la-yhwh*),  "lest a plague come upon them at their registration" (*lōʾ-yihyeh ḇāhem neḡep̄ bip̄qōḏ ʾōṯām*). The explicit connection between registration (√*pqd*) and plague (*neḡep̄*) again passes without explanation, but again, the stipulation that those registered must provide a ransom (a half-shekel to the sanctuary and a half-shekel as "an offering to Yahweh" [*tərûmāh la-yhwh*]) opens the possibility for ritual failure. In both cases (maintaining ritual purity and making ransoms), the near-certain failure of some percentage of the population provide a plausible explanation for the association of people-counting and plague.

At the literary level, then, the function of the pericope could---as with much of the so-called History of David's Rise (HDR)---be understood as an *apologia* for David's putative decision to ask for a census (against Joab's advice) and a subsequent calamity perceived to be caused by it. If the story originated from a time when it was well-known that David had commanded the census, the story provides an explanation for why David made the decision (at Yahweh's prompting) despite the (apparent) risk of plague that accompanied numbering the people.[@mccarter1984, 518] Furthermore, David's self-sacrificial posture on display in his willingness to take on the punishment personally and by his willingness to purchase Araunah's threshing floor (at full price) and make the appropriate offerings to Yahweh.

### 1 Chronicles 21

While the broad strokes of the 2 Sam 24 and 1 Chron 21 remain quite similar, a few relatively small modifications to the account preserved in 1 Chron 21 dramatically alters the literary and theological significance of the tale.

#### Yahweh or (a) Satan?

The Chronicler's narrative most noticable change is seen in the shift in explaining who incited David to take the census in the first place. While 2 Sam 24 attributes this act to Yahweh, 1 Chron 21 introduces a new figure to the story referred to as *śāṭān*. 1 Chron 21:1 reads:

> *way-yaʿămōḏ śāṭān ʿal-yiśrāʾēl way-yāseṯ ʾeṯ-dāwı̂ḏ limnôṯ ʾeṯ-yiśrāʾēl*
>
> [a] *śāṭān* stood up against Israel and he incited David to count Israel.

Scholars remain divided over whether *śāṭān* should be understood as a simple indefinite noun "an adversary," [@stokes_jbl2009; @japhet2009, 114--117; @japhet1993, 370--390] or whether the absence of the definite article indicates that by the time of the Chronicler, Satan referred to a malevolent spirit which prefigured the more developed, personified "Satan" found in the New Testament.[@rollston_keith-stuckenbruck2016, 4--5]  The most common usage of the term *śāṭān* in the Hebrew Bible refers to human adversaries and accusers generally (see, Num 22:22, 32; 1 Sam 29:4, 2 Sam 19:23; 1 Kgs 5:18, 11:14, 23, 25; Ps 38:21, 71:13, 109:4, 6, 20, 29). However, the figure *haś-śāṭān* (wth definite article) in both the prologue to Job (chs. 1--2) and Zech 3:1--2 appears as a celestial figure to whom Yahweh speaks directly.[^zech] Proponents of reading *śāṭān* as the personal name of a malevolent spirit argue that the absence of the definite article indicates that the idea of *the śāṭān* of Job and Zechariah had evolved into a fully personified Satan by the time of the Chronicler.[@braun1986, 216--217; @coggins1976, 107; Rollston also finds this reading compelling, though, not without difficulties. See, @rollston_keith-stuckenbruck2016, 4--5] Additionally, while the LXX hails from a slightly later chronological horizon than Chronicles, it is worth noting that the translator used the indefinite substantive *diabolos* to translate *śāṭān*---the same term used in Job and Zechariah (also, Ps 108:6) *with* a definite article---which gives some indication that, in the mind of the translator, these passages likely referred to the same entity.[^diabolos]

[^diabolos]: Elsewhere the LXX renders the nominal forms of *śāṭān* with the feminine *diabolē* or, in the case of 1 Kgs 11:14, simply in transliteration as *satan*. It should be noted, however, that Esther 7:4 and 8:1 render the Hebrew √ṣrr as the masculine *diabolos* as well.

Critics of this view, however, have pointed to the fact that in other cases in the Hebrew Bible, generic nouns that are treated as personal names or titles often *do* retain the definite article.[@japhet2009, 114--117; @japhet1993, 370--390] Japhet, for example, notes that direct references to the Canaanite deity Baʿal are always accompanied by the definite article. In every instance, the name/title *baʿal* is made grammatically definite whether by adding the definite article, through the use of pronominal suffixes or being in construct with an explicitly definite noun.[@japhet2009, 115; citing @geseniuskautzsch1910, §126d] In such a case, *śāṭān* should simply be understood as an indefinite noun, "an accuser" and may be understood as a human antagonist of David.[@stokes_jbl2009; @japhet2009, 114--117; @japhet1993, 370--390] 

[^zech]: This notion is more clear in Job, where haś-śāṭān is described in the heavenly courts and is described as having supernatural powers over the health and prosperity of those on the Earth. On the other hand, the reference in Zechariah is somewhat ambiguous. Zech 3:1 reads: *way-yarʾēnı̂ ʾeṯ-yəhôšuaʿ hak-kōhēn hag-gāḏôl ʿōmēḏ lip̄nê malʾaḵ yhwh wə-haś-śāṭān ʿōmēḏ ʿal-yəmı̂nô ləśiṭnô*, "And he showed me Joshua, the high priest standing before the angel of Yahweh, and *haś-śāṭān* was standing on his right (side) to accuse him." The antecedent of "his" in "his right(side)" is unclear. If "his" refers to the *malʾaḵ yhwh*, then haś-śāṭān likely refers to some kind of spiritual being. However, it is possible that "his" refers to Joshua, and that haś-śāṭān should be understood as a human adversary.

Regardless of how one understands *śāṭān* to be functioning,  the author of Chronicles plainly understood the mechanisms at work---whether supernatural or interpersonal---differently than the author of 2 Sam 24. Chronicles, therefore, shifts the incitement away from Yahweh and removes any reference to the deity's anger prior to the census, thereby simplifying the rationale for David's guilt and Yahweh's retribution. The resulting narrative removes the problematic "entrapment" of David  and absolves Yahweh from seeming so "mercurial" [@rollston_keith-stuckenbruck2016, 4].

#### The Threshing Floor of Araunah/Ornan and the Temple of Solomon

The pericope in 1 Chron 21 likewise ends with a significant deviation from its hypotext preserved in 2 Sam 24. While both accounts describe the angel of Yahweh relenting from his destructive activities at the threshing floor of Araunah (=Ornan in 1 Chron 21) the Jebusite, the significance of the site as the future location of the Temple of Yahweh in Jerusalem is made explicit only in the Chronicler's account. The Chronicler makes the explicit assertion that the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite would become the spot for the construction of the temple of Solomon by putting it on the lips of David himself in 1 Chr 22:1, stating :

> *wayyōʾmer dāwı̂ḏ zeh hûʾ bêṯ yhwh hāʾĕlōhı̂m wəzeh-mizbēaḥ ləʿōlāh ləyiśrāʾēl*
>
>  Then David said, "This is the Temple of Yahweh, God, and this altar for burnt offerings is for Israel"

The declaration is fulfilled in 2 Chr 3:1 when Solomon begins to construct the temple:

> *wayyāḥel šəlōmōh liḇnôṯ ʾeṯ-bêṯ-yhwh bı̂rûšālaim bəhar hammôrı̂ā ʾăšer nirʾāh ləḏāwı̂ḏ ʾāḇı̂hû ʾăšer hēḵı̂n bimqôm dāwı̂ḏ bəḡōren ʾornān ha-yəḇûsı̂*
>
> Solomon began to build the temple of Yahweh in Jerusalem on mount Moriah, where Yahweh appeared to David, his father, where David had designated, at the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.

The question of whether the author of the account in 2 Sam 24 understood this story to be an etiological account of the founding of the Jerusalem temple or whether this detail was the invention of the Chronicler, however, is not clear from the biblical text. In fact, unlike the book of Chronicles which gives the precise location of the temple of Solomon,  Isaac Kalimi has suggested that the reason for its neglect in the Deuteronomistic History can be attributed to the assertion that the location of the temple in Jerusalem (as well as all the other temples in the Hebrew Bible, whose locations are not specified) was common knowledge and thus such that "there was no need to mention them."[@kalimi_htr1990, 355--356]
