# Chronicles

Scholars or the Hebrew Bible have long observed that the book of Chronicles  is a derivative work of Samuel--Kings which reflects the concerns and religious sensibilities of the late Persian or Early Hellenistic Periods. For example, in his classic work on the history of ancient Israel, Wellhausen begins his treatment of the history of traditions within Judaism with a lengthy discussion of Chronicles which, he observes,  differs from the history of Israel portrayed in Samuel--Kings due to the chronological distance of the works and the intervention of the Priestly Code into the theology of  ~2T Judaism[@wellhausen1957, 171--172] While the particulars of the relationship of Sam--Kings to Chronicles and the nuances of Priestly influences on the Hebrew Bible remain subject to scholarly debate, the broad consensus remains that the book of Chronicles was written sometime in the late Persian or early Hellenistic periods, heavily utilizing the books of Samuel and Kings as source material, and bearing an ideological *Tendenz* influenced by (though not identical to) the final layers of the Pentateuch.[For a thorough and reasonably recent summary of the *status questionis*, see @knoppers2003, 72--89; See also @japhet1993; @japhet2009; @braun1986; and @coggins1976] 

It is unsurprising, therefore, that memory studies has become an influential lens with which to study the book of Chronicles. Over the past few decades, the scholarly discourse surrounding the composition of Chronicles has increasingly turned to memory studies as a robust framework for describing the processes by which Chronicles and other biblical traditions were produced and transmitted.[@benzvi_st2017;  @wright2014, 148--166; @blenkinsopp2013; @benzvi-a_evans-williams2013; @benzvi-b_evans-williams2013] 

[^chronicler]: Throughout this chapter I will refer to "the Chronicler" to refer simply to the the author or authors who are responsible for the book of Chronicles and not, as others have used the term, to refer to the common author of Chronicles, Ezra and Nehemiah.
