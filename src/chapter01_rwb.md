## Vermes: Scripture and Tradition in Judaism
<!-- Introduce S&T -->
The scholarly discussion of the Rewritten Bible began with Geza Vermes' pioneering work on early jewish exegetical traditions, *Scripture and Tradition in Judaism: Haggadic Studies* published in 1961.[@vermes1961] Prior to the mid-twentieth century, the prevailing approach to the study of haggadic exegesis was to treat the haggadah as originating with novel biblical interpretation made by individuals and focused primarily on texts which modern Judaism still considered authentic. As Vermes recounts, haggadic traditions were viewed as "the result of the adoption, and anonymous repetition, of popular interpretations by favourite preachers" [@vermes1961, 3]. Furthermore, the Tannaitic interpretations, dated from the second century CE (represented by Targums Onkelos and Jonathan) were considered the most ancient haggadic traditions. Thus a good number of ancient texts—apocrypha, pseudepigrapha, and sectarian texts—were excluded from discussions of the origins of haggadic exegesis.

A series of publications and discoveries beginning in the 1930's, however, began to undermine the notion that these early exegetical traditions began in the second century CE. Vermes credits this broadening of haggadic studies to a series of major studies and discoveries such as Rappaport's *Agada und Exegese bei Flavius Josephus*,[@rappaport1930] Paul Kahle's Schweich Lectures at the British Academy on the Cairo Geniza (given in 1941, published 1947),[@kahle1947] Kisch's new text edition of Ps. Philo's *Liber Antiquitatum Biblicarum* (1949),[@kisch1949] the discovery of the Dead Sea scrolls (1948) and Codex Neofiti (1956), as well as (and perhaps especially) Renée Bloch's work on midrash [@bloch1954; @bloch1955; translated and reedited as @bloch1955_repr; @vermes1961, 3--7]. The overarching theme among these works was the hard evidence for a methodological continuity between early interpretive traditions and later haggadah. For example, Vermes notes that Rappaport's work on *Jewish Antiquities* identified substantial overlaps between Josephus's text and  Rabbinic haggadah. He suggested, therefore, that Josephus had drawn from an already living tradition of interpretation. The implication of his suggestion is that the haggadah of the second century were not novel exegetical works, but were themselves products of earlier exegetical traditions.

According to Vermes's introduction, the explicitly stated purpose of the work, therefore, was to push the field beyond synchronic analysis of haggadah toward diachronic, historical analyses to trace the development of these exegetical traditions [@vermes1961, 1].

The first six chapters of the book offers a series of studies which bring various works of early jewish exegesis into conversation with later rabbinic traditions. In them Vermes surveys a number of biblical passages and themes alongside their varied post-biblical manifestations with the goal of tracing the historical evolution and interdependence (or, in some cases independence) of each tradition. Each study follows a somewhat formulaic pattern of synoptic presentation, explanation, and analysis, but each is meant to illustrate a particular aspect of the relationship between the earliest detectable interpretive traditions of the Hebrew Bible and the later traditions contained within the targums, haggadah, and midrashic materials.

The first three chapters of *Scripture and Tadition* make up Part I of Vermes's study, entitled, " The Symbolism of Words." In this section, Vermes focuses on the way that individual words and ideas take on localized symbolic meanings which are then applied globally to the interpretation of the Bible. In his first chapter, he notes the divergent treatment of Gen 44:18--19 among ancient commentators and proceeds through a synoptic study of this passage in the Fragmentary Targum, Targum Neofiti, and the Tosefta of Targum Yerushalmi. He concludes that the Fragmentary Targum represents the most primitive work, whose interpretive strategy is essentially inner-biblical (by harmonizing Gen 44 and 49 with Exod 7--9), followed by the Tosefta, which seems to depend on the Fragmentary Targum but takes a different interpretive stance, and finally Targum Neofiti, which combines the two. In this second chapter, Vermes examines the way that the word "Lebanon" came to be used symbolically in the Hebrew Bible and other jewish literature and how those symbolic meanings developed, particularly the association of Lebanon with Jerusalem and the Temple. He identifies the Song of Songs as the intermediary text which helped to establish this tradition within post-exilic Judaism, noting that the book occupies the unique position as the only biblical text which clearly uses the name Lebanon symbolically for the Temple. Importantly, Vermes shows that the symbolic use of Lebanon to represent Jerusalem and the Temple is rooted in *biblical* exegesis. This is a key idea for Vermes because it establishes a continuitty between the production of the biblical text and its later interpretation. In chapter three, Vermes examines other words which take on symbolic meaning in later Jewish texts ("lion," "Damascus," "*Meḥoqeq*," and "Man"), and shows the relative similarity of the process between the DSS texts and the targumic and midrashic materials.

It is in the second part of *Scripture and Tradition*  that the topic of  Rewritten Bible is addressed most directly. This section---titled "The Rewritten Bible"--- covers two chapters (chapters four and five), both focusing on the figure Abraham and the haggadic traditions surrounding his life.

In chapter four, Vermes embarks on what he calls a "retrogressive historical study" by which he means beginning with the traditions in their later, more developed forms, and working back toward their origins. In this case, Vermes begins with the 11th century CE text *Sefer ha-Yashar* (and the varied extra-biblical traditions contained therein) then works backward to identify sections of the text which exhibit earlier traditions, for example, in Targums, Josephus, Jubilees, (Ps.) Philo, and others. The purpose of this chapter is to demonstrate that even late texts can contain valuable information about earlier methods of exegesis. As Vermes puts it, "[Sefer ha-Yashar] manifests a direct continuity with the corresponding tradition of the time of the second Temple, but reflects also the influence of the haggadah of the Tannaim and Amoraim" [@vermes1961, 95].

In chapter five, Vermes proceeds with a "progressive historical study," by which he means a study beginning with the oldest materials and working forward. Still focusing on the figure Abraham, Vermes treats in detail the relationship between Gen 12:8--15:4 and cols. 19--22 of the Genesis Apocryphon. Vermes treats Genesis Apocryphon as "the most ancient midrash of all"[@vermes1961, 124] and views it as the "lost link between the biblical and the Rabbinic midrash" [@vermes1961, 124]. As I understand it, the Genesis Apocryphon, for Vermes, occupies a unique position just one step removed from inner-biblical exegesis. The task of GA's author was "to make the biblical story more attractive, more real, more edifying, and above all more intelligible" and he accomplishes this through a variety of means [@vermes1961, 125]. The work of the GA author, therefore, was to "[reconcile] unexplained or apparently conflicting statements in the biblical text in order to allay doubt and worry" [@vermes1961, 125]. According to Vermes, the interpretation of Genesis is "organically bound" to the text of Genesis and the additions that *were*  made sprung from the interpretation of the Bible itself and not whole-sale from the mind of the author [@vermes1961, 126]. Where texts like Jubliees sought to systematically advance a theological vision, according to Vermes, the author of GA intended to simply "explain the biblical text," calling it illustrative of "the unbiased rewriting of the Bible" [@vermes1961, 126].

The final two chapters make up the final section, titled "Theology and Exegesis" and push the discussion to include early Christianity. Chapter seven is entitled "Circumcision and Exodus 4:24--26" but offers a subtitle of "Prelude to the Theology of Baptism," which gives some hint at the ultimate, if tacit, goal of the chapter. Discussing the topic of circumcision in Ex 4:24--26 and its treatment among the early exegetes, Vermes's primary observation is simply that the theology of circumcision and the exegetical traditions which surrounded it, were affected by historical forces and theological ideologies. For instance, he claims that Jubilees omitted the rather odd statement that God was going to kill Moses---who was saved by the circumcision of his son by Zipporah---because "It was impossible for its author to accept that God tried to kill Moses as it was for him to believe that Moses neglected to circumcise his son on the eighth day after his birth" [@vermes1961, 185]. Similarly, he notes that after the Bar Kokhba rebellion, the practice of circumcision was outlawed and so, "it is not surprising, therefore, to find the spiritual authorities of Palestinian Judaism emphasizing the greatness and necessity of this essential rite, and explaining away ... every possible biblical excuse for delaying the circumcision of their children" [@vermes1961, 189]. He ends the chapter by suggesting that the early Christian association of baptism with circumcision (citing Rom 4:3--4 and Col 2:11--12) was enabled by the traditional Jewish association of circumcision withe blood sacrifice ("the Blood of the Covenant")[@vermes1961, 190]. That Paul (to whom he attributes both Romans and Colossians) associated baptism with circumcision therefore, was "not due, therefore, to his own insight, but springs directly from the contemporary Jewish doctrine of circumcision which he adopted and adapted" [@vermes1961, 191].

Vermes makes a similar move in chapter eight, entitled "Redemption and Genesis XXII: The Binding of Isaac and the Sacrifice of Jesus." In it, he compares a number of ancient works' treatment of the Aqedah and demonstrates how the (near-) sacrifice of Isaac became a prototype for the entire sacrificial system in later judaism. The sacrifice of animals in the Temple functioned as a "reminder" to God of the faithfulness of Abraham. Furthermore, he shows the ways the tradition grew to focus on the willingness of Isaac to be sacrificed and his function as a proto-matryr. Thus, he ends the chapter by addressing the New Testament's portrayal of Jesus as a willing sacrifice to God and its putative relationship to the Aqedah. Vermes makes the case that the redemptive theology of the NT---typically attributed to Paul---was not original to him. He writes:

> For although [Paul] is undoubtedly the greatest theologian of the Redemption, he worked with inherited materials and among these was, by his own confession, the tradition that "Christ dies for us according to the Scriptures." [@vermes1961, 221]

He then proceeds to push the origin of this theology back further into the first century CE, and, in rather dramatic fashion, suggests that the introduction of the Aqedah motif into Christian theology---by means of the Suffering Servant---may have been by Jesus himself [@vermes1961, 223].

He concludes the chapter by discussing the Aqedah and the Eucharist. Just as the whole sacrificial system pointed back toward the binding of Isaac in targumic exegesis, the eucharistic rite likewise was intended---according to Vermes---to point back to Jesus's redemptive sacrifice. Thus he concludes:

> Although it would be inexact to hold that the Eucharistic doctrine of the New Testament, together with the whole Christian doctrine of Redemption, is nothing but a Christian version of the Jewish Akedah theology, it is nevertheless true that in the formation of this doctrine the targumic representation of the Binding of Isaac has played an essential role.

> Indeed, without the help of Jewish exegesis it is impossible to perceive any Christian teaching in its true perspective.[@vermes1961, 227]

## Beyond Scripture and Tradition
Although rightly cited as the work that introduced the term "Rewritten Bible" to the field, it is worth noting that in *Scripture and Tradition*, the identification and definition of the phenomenon of RwB is a secondary concern to Vermes's larger thesis about the historical evolution of haggadic exegesis in antiquity. Something about the term, however, caught the attention of the field and a number of scholars have since taken up the task of studying the phenomenon of Rewritten Bible in its own right.  The scope, purpose, and meaning of the term Rewritten Bible (and the more common Rewritten Scripture) has now been the topic of scholarly discussion for some time now so it will be beneficial to map out the major positions of the past several decades before providing a brief *status quaestionis* and my own thoughts on the matter.

### Early Positions
I have selected three early contributors to the topic of RwB who are representative of distinct approaches to describing these texts: George Nickelsburg, Daniel Harrington, and Philip Alexander. While there is some overlap, Nickelsburg and Harrington represent a less rigid, non-generic, approach to RwB, while Alexander represents those who see RwB as constituting a distinct generic category.

#### George Nickelsburg
<!-- 620 -->
In his 1984 article "The Bible Rewritten and Expanded," George Nickelsburg discusses a number of texts which are "very closely related to the biblical texts, expanding and paraphrasing them and implicitly commenting on them" [@nickelsburg_stone1984, 89].  Thus, for Nickelsburg, Rewritten Bible was not a discrete category of texts. Moreover, Nickelsburg's article involves more than just "rewritten" texts (as the title indicates), and also discusses texts which introduce wholly new material into the traditions of the Bible [@nickelsburg_stone1984, 89--90]. However, he does provide a list of texts which he loosely describes as examples of biblical rewriting: 1 Enoch, Book of Giants, Jubilees, Genesis Apocryphon, Biblical Antiquities, the Books of Adam and Eve (Apocalypse of Moses, Life of Adam and Eve), and some Hellenistic Jewish Poets. The inclusion of 1 Enoch is novel, compared to Vermes's original list, and illustrates the more expansive view that Nickelsburg has toward RwB.[^nick-more]

[^nick-more]: Nickelsburg also includes in his discussion a few works by hellenistic Jewish poets. These works include Philo's *On Jerusalem*, Theodotus's *On the Jews*, and the *Exagoge* by one "Ezekiel the Poet of Tragedies."

One of the key contributions that Nickelsburg makes is his idea that rewriting followed a trajectory from smaller units of rewriting---involving short stories that deal with particular events from the biblical text---to longer, more systematic, treatments which span multiple biblical books. His treatment of 1 Enoch (which is, at least in part, the earliest text that he deals with) is illustrative of this approach. Rather than dealing with 1 Enoch as a whole, Nickelsburg addresses the various rewritings of the flood narrative throughout 1 Enoch as well as in the Book of Giants (which is not formally a part of 1 Enoch, but has a clear connection to the work). This interaction of 1 Enoch with the biblical text revolves around a single event, the flood, and its causes. The Genesis Apocryphon, on the other hand, seems to span most of Genesis; Jubilees covers Genesis through the beginning of Exodus, and *LAB* covers Genesis through the death of Saul in 1 Samuel.

Although Nickelsburg generally accepts that the rewritten texts "comment" on the Bible, he notes that the posture toward the biblical text is also not uniform among even the agreed upon RwB texts. He notes, for example, that while the author of Jubilees's concerns are largely halakhic and the book makes explicit reference to the biblical text, the authority assumed by the author of Jubilees does not (at least rhetorically) originate in the exposition of the Torah, but in the "immutable heavenly tablets" [@nickelsburg_stone1984, 100--101]. Nickelsburg thus states:

>   This process of transmitting and revising the biblical text reflects a remarkable view of Scripture and tradition. The pseudepigraphic ascription of the book to an angel of the presence and the attribution of laws to the heavenly tablets invest the author's interpretation of Scripture with absolute divine authority" [@nickelsburg_stone1984, 101].

In contrast, the Genesis Apocryphon seems to have very little interest in halakhic matters and instead seems to just elaborate on the story by giving detailed geographic details and more dramatic characters [@nickelsburg_stone1984, 106]. Finally, he observes that *LAB* likewise differs with Jubilees in its omission of halakhic matters and its "highly selective reproduction of the text" [@nickelsburg_stone1984, 110]. This selectivity also differs from the Genesis Apocryphon, which otherwise is "characterized by the addition of lengthy non-biblical incidence" [@nickelsburg_stone1984, 110].

Nickelsburg differs from Vermes mainly in the way he views the Bible during the late Second Temple period. Although Nickelsburg observes that the preoccupation with certain texts suggests that they were held in high regard, he does not have the same interest in tying the exegetical practices of, for example, Jubilees, with earlier inner-biblical or later haggadic traditions.

#### Daniel Harrington (1986)
<!-- 360 -->
Daniel Harrington's 1986 contribution entitled "Palestinian Adaptations of Biblical Narratives and Prophecies I: The Bible Rewritten (Narratives)," adopts the term "Rewritten Bible" to talk about texts produced around the turn of the era by Palestinian Judaism that  "take as their literary framework the flow of the biblical text itself and apparently have as their major purpose the clarification and actualization of the biblical story" [@harrington_kraft-nickelsburg1986, 239]. Compared to Vermes, he operates with a slightly expanded list of rewritten texts. In addition to Jubilees, Genesis Apocryphon, Ps. Philo's *Biblical Antiquities* and Josephus's *Jewish Antiquities*, he also includes the Assumption of Moses and 11QTemple (Temple Scroll). Furthermore, he makes a point to suggest that a number of other texts may be able to be included in the list, including *Paralipomena of Jeremiah*, *Life of Adam and Eve/Apocalypse of Moses*, and *Ascension of Isaiah*.

Harrington's major contribution is his explicit rejection of RwB as a category or literary genre in favor of a process-oriented approach. In this respect, Harrington takes a broad view of rewriting and allows, to some degree, that this process be understood similar to a reception history (although, this is my term, and not his). He states:

>   Nevertheless, establishing that these books are not appropriately described as targums or midrashim is not the same as proving that they all represent a distinctive literary genre called "rewritten Bible." In fact, it seems better to view rewriting the Bible as a kind of activity or process than to see it as a distinctive literary genre of Palestinian Judaism" [@harrington_kraft-nickelsburg1986, 242--243]

 Instead, he observes that while texts such as Jubilees and *Assumption of Moses* both constitute a rewriting of the Bible, both "are formally revelations of apocalypses" [@harrington_kraft-nickelsburg1986, 243]. This is an important criticism of scholars who see RwB as a distinct genre. Unlike, for example, the Gospels, which arguably have the same basic "form," the texts typically described as "rewritten" come in a variety of "forms" such as narratives (Genesis Apocryphon), apocalypses (Jubilees), and, legal (Temple Scroll). In other words, a single *genre*---insofar as the word describes a literary *form*---is not sufficient to subsume the varied *forms* which all can be described as "rewritten."

#### Philip Alexander (1988)
<!-- 660 -->
While Nickelsburg and Harrington make important observations about Rewritten Bible, Philip Alexander's 1988 article, "Retelling the Old Testament," stands out as perhaps the most significant early contribution to RwB studies after *Scripture and Tradition* and remains one of the most thorough treatments of the idea of a RwB "genre." Alexander's goal is to examine the use of the biblical text within the so-called RwB texts to determine whether they form a distinct genre and whether there exists a set of concrete criteria by which scholars can admit or exclude texts from the category [@alexander_carson-williamson1988, 99].

Through a series of four case studies (Jubilees, Genesis Apocryphon, *Liber Antiquitatum Biblicarum*, and Josephus's *Jewish Antiquities*) Alexander determines that RwB *does* form a distinct literary genre and sets out nine "principal characteristics" of RwB, which deserve to be enumerated here:

1.  They are *narratives* which follow the order of the biblical text. He broadly refers to the texts as "histories" (as distinct from theological treatise).

2. They are "free standing" literary works that take on the same form as the text that they rewrite. As such, they do not "comment" on the text explicitly, but weave a seamless retelling of the biblical story.

3. They are not meant to replace the biblical work.

4. They cover a great deal of biblical narrative. Here he also notes that certain works which are primarily "expansive" (the Book of Giants, the Book of Noah) probably should not count because their relationship to the biblical text is "centrifugal," while properly RwB texts are "centripetal" to the biblical text (more on this, below).

5. They follow the biblical text's narrative order, but do not, necessarily include everything. They are "highly selective in what they represent"[@alexander_carson-williamson1988, 117], but do not omit so much that the integrity of the biblical account is compromised. He notes "A proper balance between the 'literal' and the 'non-literal' sections is probably of fundamental importance to the genre" [@alexander_carson-williamson1988, 117].

6. They offer an interpretive reading of Scripture which (quoting Vermes) offer "a fuller, smoother and doctrinally more advanced form of the sacred narrative"[@alexander_carson-williamson1988, 117; citing @schurer1986, 305] and seem to functionas a sort of commentary. In this way, the text is meant to be supplementary to the biblical text (see \#3) [@alexander_carson-williamson1988, 117].

7. They are limited by their particular (narrative) form and are only able to offer a *single* interpretation of the rewritten text. Alexander contrasts this with those of the Rabbis and Philo who are each able to offer multiple interpretations of the a single text, and thus, "treat the underlying text as polyvalent" [@alexander_carson-williamson1988, 117].

8. They are further limited by their form which does not allow them to explain their exegetical reasoning.[^explain]

[^explain]: He writes: "The methods by which they solve the problems of the original are essentially midrashic, i.e. similar to those found in the rabbinic midrashim. But unlike the midrashim (or Philo) they cannot make explicit their midrashic working."  @alexander_carson-williamson1988 [118]

9. They incorporate material which is not exegetically derived from the biblical text---such as oral tradition, legends, etc.---and fuse it with the rewritten text.

Although I disagree with his conclusions, Alexander's treatment is thorough and he advances the conversation in a few important ways. Perhaps the most significant contribution that he makes is the introduction of the extremely helpful terms "centrifugal" and "centripetal" to describe a text's relationship to the Bible. He writes:  

> Rewritten Bible texts are centripetal: they come back to the Bible again and again. The rewritten Bible texts make use of the legendary material, but by placing that material within an extended biblical narrative (in association with passages of more or less literal retelling of the Bible), they clamp the legends firmly to the biblical framework, and reintegrate them into the biblical history." [@alexander_carson-williamson1988, 117]

The major advantage to limiting RwB to texts which exhibit a centripetal relationship to the biblical text is the removal from consideration of works which merely allude to the Bible.
