# The Rewritten Bible

## Introduction

## Vermes on Rewritten Bible
Although cited as the work that introduced the term "Rewritten Bible," it is worth noting that in *Scripture and Tradition*, the identification and definition of the phenomenon of RwB is a secondary concern to Vermes's larger thesis about the historical evolution of haggadic exegesis in antiquity. The explicitly stated purpose of the work, according to the book's introduction, was to push the field of haggadic studies beyond synchronic analysis of haggadic exegesis toward diachronic, historical analyses in order to trace the development of these exegetical traditions [@vermes1961, 1]. The phrase "rewritten Bible" shows up in *Scripture and Tradition* almost without comment. It does not seem to carry a specific, technical, meaning for Vermes, but is a catch-all term to describe texts which incorperate biblical traditions but are not a part of the traditional corpus of rabbinic texts.


Prior to the mid-twentieth century, the prevailing approach to the study of haggadic exegesis was to treat the haggadah as originating with novel biblical interpretation made by individuals and focused primarily on texts which modern Judaism still considered authentic. As Vermes puts it, "Apparent haggadic 'traditions' are the result of the adoption, and anonymous repetition, of popular interpretations by favourite preachers" [@vermes1961, 3]. The Tannaitic interpretations, dated from the second century CE (represented by Targums Onkelos and Jonathan) were considered the most ancient haggadic traditions. Thus a good number of ancient texts—apocrypha, pseudepigrapha, and sectarian texts—were excluded from discussions of the origins of haggadic exegesis.

A series of publications and discoveries beginning in the 1930's, however, began to undermine the notion that these early exegetical traditions began in the second century CE. Vermes credits this broadening of haggadic studies to Rappaport's *Agada und Exegese bei Flavius Josephus*, Kahle's Schweich Lectures at the British Academy on the Cairo Geniza, Kisch's new text edition of Ps. Philo's *Liber Antiquitatum Biblicarum* (1949), the discovery of the Dead Sea scrolls (1948) and Codex Neofiti (1956), and R. Bloch's early work on midrash [@vermes1961, 3--7]. The overarching theme among these works was the textual evidence for early traditions shared with later haggadic works. For example, Vermes notes that Rappaport's work on *Jewish Antiquities* identified substantial overlaps between Josephus's text and  Rabbinic haggadah. He suggested, therefore, that Josephus had drawn from an already living tradition of interpretation. The implication of his suggestion is that the haggadah of the second century were not novel exegetical works, but were themselves products of earlier exegetical traditions.

### Part 1
In the first section of *Scripture and Tradition*, titled "The Symbolism of Words," Vermes establishes his methodology of tracing the development of haggadic tradition historically. While the particulars of his argument are not immediately relevant for our purposes, it is important to note that Vermes spends the bulk of these three initial chapters comparing how certain ancient texts preserved, reused, and developed various exegetical traditions and proposing an order of dependence based on their similarity. His method resembles textual criticism and he operates largely on the principle of *lectio brevior*, although this is nowhere stated.

In his first chapter, he notes the divergent treatment of Gen 44:18--19 among ancient commentators and proceeds through a synoptic study of this passage in the Fragmentary Targum, Targum Neofiti, and the Tosefta of Targum Yerushalmi. He concludes that the Fragmentary Targum represents the most primitive work, whose interpretive strategy is essentially inner-biblical (by harmonizing Gen 44 and 49 with Exod 7--9), followed by the Tosefta, which seems to depend on the Fragmentary Targum but takes a different interpretive stance, and finally Targum Neofiti, which combines the two. In this second chapter, Vermes examines the way that the word "Lebanon" came to be used symbolically in the Second Temple literature and how that symbolic use continued to develop. He identifies the Song of Songs as the intermediary text which helped to establish the tradition for post-exilic Judaism, noting that it occupies the unique position as the only biblical text which clearly uses the name Lebanon symbolically for the Temple. Thus he shows that the symbolic use of Lebanon as representing Jerusalem and the Temple is rooted in *biblical* exegesis. Following up on his observations in chapter two, Vermes then proceeds to examine other words which take on symbolic meaning in later Jewish texts, and shows the relative similarity of the process between the DSS texts and the targumic and midrashic materials. Specifically, he treats the terms "lion," "Damascus," "*Meḥoqeq*," and "Man."

### Part 2
It is in the second part of *Scripture and Tradition*  that the topic of  Rewritten Bible is addressed most directly. This section---titled "The Rewritten Bible"--- covers two chapters (chapters four and five), both focusing on the figure Abraham and the haggadic traditions surrounding his life.

In chapter four, Vermes embarks on what he calls a "retrogressive historical study" by which he means beginning with the traditions in their later, more developed forms, and working back toward their origins. In this case, Vermes begins with *Sefer ha-Yashar* and the varied extra-biblical traditions contained therein, and works backward by identifying sections of various texts where antecedent traditions show up---in Targums, Josephus, Jubilees, (Ps.) Philo, and others. The purpose of this chapter is to demonstrate that even late texts can contain valuable information about earlier methods of exegesis and, as Vermes puts it:

> [Sefer ha-Yashar] manifests a direct continuity with the corresponding tradition of the time of the second Temple, but reflects also the influence of the haggadah of the Tannaim and Amoraim [@vermes1961, 95].

Relating specifically to the topic of RwB, Vermes writes:

> Finally, this examination of the Yashar story fully illustrates what is meant by the term "rewritten Bible." In order to anticipate questions, and to solve problems in advance, the midrashist inserts haggadic development into the biblical narrative---an exegetical process which is probably as ancient as scriptural interpretation itself [@vermes1961, 95].

In chapter five, Vermes proceeds with a "progressive historical study," by which he means a study beginning with the oldest materials and working forward. Still focusing on the figure Abraham, Vermes treats in detail the relationship between Gen 12:8--15:4 and cols. 19--22 of the Genesis Apocryphon.[^ga_col]

[^ga_col]: !! It is noteworthy that these columns represent some of the most "literal" of the GA stuff, if I recall correctly. I.e., it may not be the best section of GA to use as represenatative of the genre. For instance, this is all in the third person. Vermes doesn't seem to consider that the GA may be a composite text, either. !!

Vermes treats Genesis Apocryphon as "the most ancient midrash of all" and views it as the "lost link between the biblical and the Rabbinic midrash" [@vermes1961, 124]. As I understand it, the Genesis Apocryphon, for Vermes, occupies a unique position just one step removed from inner-biblical exegesis. Vermes writes:

> the author of GA does indeed try, by every means at his disposal, to make the biblical story more attractive, more real, more edifying, and above all more intelligible. [@vermes1961, 125]

The work of the GA author, therefore, was to "[reconcile] unexplained or apparently conflicting statements in the biblical text in order to allay doubt and worry" [@vermes1961, 125] and the interpretation of Genesis is "organically bound" to the text of Genesis directly and the author "never attempts to introduce unrelated or extraneous matter[s]" [@vermes1961, 126]. Where texts like Jubliees sought to systematically advance a theological vision, according to Vermes, the author of GA intended to simply "explain the biblical text," calling it illustrative of "the unbiased rewriting of the Bible" [@vermes1961, 126].

### Part 3
In chapter six, Vermes engages in a lengthy analysis of the traditions concerning Balaam. While the majority of post-biblical texts treat Balaam as a villain, in at least *LAB*, he is treated as a sort of tragic hero [@vermes1961, 173]. The portrayal of Balaam as a wicked prophet began within the nexus of biblical tradition itself. Vermes notes that the various documentary strata of the Balaam story cast the prophet in differing lights, and it is the final stratum, the P layer, which got the final say---within the biblical text---about him. That said, Vermes points out that ignoring the Preistly additions yields a story somewhat similar to that of *LAB*. Thus, Vermes concludes that the exegetical traditions found in the later Targums and rabbinic works are simply the continuation of the exegetical strategies employed within the Bible itself, which he calls "biblical midrash or haggadah" [@vermes1961, 176].

### Part 4
Chapter seven begins Vermes's turn toward the broader goal of bringing all ancient exegesis under the same general umbrella. Discussing the topic of circumcision in Ex 4:24--26 and its treatment among the early exegetes, Vermes's primary observation is simply that the theology of circumcision and the exegetical traditions which surrounded it, were affected by the historical forces and theological ideologies. For instance, he claims that Jubilees omitted the rather odd statement that God was going to kill Moses---who was saved by the circumcision of his son by Zipporah---because "It was impossible for its author to accept that God tried to kill Moses as it was for him to believe that Moses neglected to circumcise his son on the eighth day after his birth" [@vermes1961, 185]. Similarly, he notes that after the Bar Kokhba rebellion, the practice of circumcision was outlawed and so, "it is not surprising, therefore, to find the spiritual authorities of Palestinian Judaism emphsizing the greatness and necessity of this essential rite, and explaining away, for the sake of those who were afraid, or hesitated, every possible biblical excuse for delaying the circumcision of their children" [@vermes1961, 189]. He ends the chapter by suggesting that the early Christian association of baptism with circumcision (citing Rom 4:3--4 and Col 2:11--12) was enabled by the traditional Jewish association of circumcision withe blood sacrifice ("the Blood of the Covenant")[@vermes1961, 190]. That Paul (to whom he attributes both Romans and Colossians) associated Baptism with circumcision therefore, was "not due, therefore, to his own insight, but springs directly from the contemporary Jewish doctrine of circumcision which he adopted and adapted" [@vermes1961, 191].
