The scholarly discussion of the Rewritten Bible began with Geza Vermes' pioneering work on Jewish haggadic studies, *Scripture and Tradition in Judaism* published in 1961.[@vermes1961]

Prior to the mid-twentieth century, the prevailing approach to the study of haggadic exegesis was to treat the haggadah as originating with novel biblical interpretation made by individuals and focused primarily on texts which modern Judaism still considered authentic. As Vermes recounts, haggadic traditions were viewed as "the result of the adoption, and anonymous repetition, of popular interpretations by favourite preachers" [@vermes1961, 3]. Furthermore, the Tannaitic interpretations, dated from the second century CE (represented by Targums Onkelos and Jonathan) were considered the most ancient haggadic traditions. Thus a good number of ancient texts—apocrypha, pseudepigrapha, and sectarian texts—were excluded from discussions of the origins of haggadic exegesis.

A series of publications and discoveries beginning in the 1930's, however, began to undermine the notion that these early exegetical traditions began in the second century CE. Vermes credits this broadening of haggadic studies to Rappaport's *Agada und Exegese bei Flavius Josephus*, Kahle's Schweich Lectures at the British Academy on the Cairo Geniza, Kisch's new text edition of Ps. Philo's *Liber Antiquitatum Biblicarum* (1949), the discovery of the Dead Sea scrolls (1948) and Codex Neofiti (1956), and Renee Bloch's early work on midrash [@vermes1961, 3--7]. The overarching theme among these works was the textual evidence for early traditions shared with later haggadic works. For example, Vermes notes that Rappaport's work on *Jewish Antiquities* identified substantial overlaps between Josephus's text and  Rabbinic haggadah. He suggested, therefore, that Josephus had drawn from an already living tradition of interpretation. The implication of his suggestion is that the haggadah of the second century were not novel exegetical works, but were themselves products of earlier exegetical traditions.

According to Vermes's introduction, the explicitly stated purpose of the work, therefore, was to push the field beyond synchronic analysis of haggadah toward diachronic, historical analyses to trace the development of these exegetical traditions [@vermes1961, 1].

The first six chapters of the book offers a series of studies which bring various works of early jewish exegesis into conversation with later rabbinic traditions. In them Vermes surveys a number of biblical passages and themes alongside their varied post-biblical manifestations with the goal of tracing the historical evolution and interdependence (or, in some cases independence) of each tradition. Each study follows a somewhat formulaic pattern of synoptic presentation, explanation, and analysis, however, each chapter is meant to illustrate a particular aspect of the relationship between the earliest detectable interpretive traditions of the Hebrew Bible and the later traditions contained within the targums, haggadah, and midrashic materials.
