# Introduction

# Vermes
Although cited as the work that introduced the term "Rewritten Bible," it is worth noting that in *Scripture and Tradition*, the identification and definition of the phenomenon of RwB is a secondary concern to Vermes's larger thesis about the historical evolution of haggadic exegesis in antiquity. The explicitly stated purpose of the work, according to the books introduction, was to push the field of haggadic studies beyond synchronic analysis of haggadic exegesis toward diachronic, historical analyses in order to trace the development of these exegetical traditions [@vermes1961, 1].

Prior to the mid-twentieth century, the prevailing approach to the study of haggadic exegesis was to treat the haggadah as originating with novel biblical interpretation made by individuals and focused primarily on texts which modern Judaism still considered authentic. As Vermes puts it, "Apparent haggadic 'traditions' are the result of the adoption, and anonymous repetition, of popular interpretations by favourite preachers" [@vermes1961, 3]. The Tannaitic interpretations, dated from the second century CE (represented by Targums Onkelos and Jonathan) were considered the most ancient haggadic traditions. Thus a good number of ancient texts—apocrypha, pseudepigrapha, and sectarian texts—were excluded from discussions of the origins of haggadic exegesis.

A series of publications and discoveries beginning in the 1930's, however, began to undermine the notion that these early exegetical traditions began in the second century CE. Vermes credits this broadening of haggadic studies to Rappaport's *Agada und Exegese bei Flavius Josephus*, Kahle's Schweich Lectures at the British Academy on the Cairo Geniza, Kisch's new text edition of Ps. Philo's *Liber Antiquitatum Biblicarum* (1949), the discovery of the Dead Sea scrolls (1948) and Codex Neofiti (1956), and R. Bloch's early work on midrash. The overarching theme among these works was the textual evidence for early traditions shared with later haggadic works. For example, Vermes notes that Rappaport's work on *Jewish Antiquities* identified substantial overlaps between Josephus's text and  Rabbinic haggadah. He suggested, therefore, that Josephus had drawn from an already living tradition of interpretation. The implication of his suggestion is that the haggadah of the second century were not novel exegetical works, but were themselves the product of an earlier exegetical tradition.
