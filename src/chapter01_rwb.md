# The Rewritten Bible

## Introduction

## Vermes
Although cited as the work that introduced the term "Rewritten Bible," it is worth noting that in *Scripture and Tradition*, the identification and definition of the phenomenon of RwB is a secondary concern to Vermes's larger thesis about the historical evolution of haggadic exegesis in antiquity. The explicitly stated purpose of the work, according to the books introduction, was to push the field of haggadic studies beyond synchronic analysis of haggadic exegesis toward diachronic, historical analyses in order to trace the development of these exegetical traditions [@vermes1961, 1].

### Introduction
Prior to the mid-twentieth century, the prevailing approach to the study of haggadic exegesis was to treat the haggadah as originating with novel biblical interpretation made by individuals and focused primarily on texts which modern Judaism still considered authentic. As Vermes puts it, "Apparent haggadic 'traditions' are the result of the adoption, and anonymous repetition, of popular interpretations by favourite preachers" [@vermes1961, 3]. The Tannaitic interpretations, dated from the second century CE (represented by Targums Onkelos and Jonathan) were considered the most ancient haggadic traditions. Thus a good number of ancient texts—apocrypha, pseudepigrapha, and sectarian texts—were excluded from discussions of the origins of haggadic exegesis.

A series of publications and discoveries beginning in the 1930's, however, began to undermine the notion that these early exegetical traditions began in the second century CE. Vermes credits this broadening of haggadic studies to Rappaport's *Agada und Exegese bei Flavius Josephus*, Kahle's Schweich Lectures at the British Academy on the Cairo Geniza, Kisch's new text edition of Ps. Philo's *Liber Antiquitatum Biblicarum* (1949), the discovery of the Dead Sea scrolls (1948) and Codex Neofiti (1956), and R. Bloch's early work on midrash [@vermes1961, 3--7]. The overarching theme among these works was the textual evidence for early traditions shared with later haggadic works. For example, Vermes notes that Rappaport's work on *Jewish Antiquities* identified substantial overlaps between Josephus's text and  Rabbinic haggadah. He suggested, therefore, that Josephus had drawn from an already living tradition of interpretation. The implication of his suggestion is that the haggadah of the second century were not novel exegetical works, but were themselves products of earlier exegetical traditions.

### Part I
In the first section of *Scripture and Tradition*, titled "The Symbolism of Words," Vermes establishes his methodology of tracing the development of haggadic tradition historically. While the particulars of his argument are not immediately relevant for our purposes, it is important to note that Vermes spends the bulk of these chapters comparing parallel texts and tracing the evolution of a particular interpretation to argue for an order of dependence.

In his first chapter, he notes the divergent treatment of Gen 44:18--19 among ancient commentators and proceeds through a synoptic study of this passage in the Fragmentary Targum (<< What is this?), Targum Neofiti, and the Tosefta of Targum Yerushalmi. He concludes that the Fragmentary Targum represents the most primitive work, whose interpretive strategy is essentially inner-biblical , followed by the Tosefta, which seems to depend on the Fragmentary Targum but takes a different interpretive stance, and finally Targum Neofiti, which combines the two.

In this second chapter, Vermes examines the way that the word "Lebanon" came to be used symbolically in the Second Temple literature and how that symbolic use continued to develop. He identifies the Song of Songs as the intermediary text which helped to establish the tradition for post-exilic Judaism, noting that it occupies the unique position as the only biblical text which clearly uses the name Lebanon symbolically for the Temple. Thus he shows that the symbolic use of Lebanon as representing Jerusalem and the Temple is rooted in *biblical* exegesis. Following up on his observations in chapter two, Vermes the proceeds to examine other words which take on symbolic meaning in later Jewish texts, and shows the relative similarity of the process between the DSS texts and the targumic and midrashic materials. Specifically, he treats the terms "lion," "Damascus," "*Meḥoqeq*," and "Man."
