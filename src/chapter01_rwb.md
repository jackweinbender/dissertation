The scholarly discussion of the Rewritten Bible began with Geza Vermes' pioneering work on early jewish exegetical traditions, *Scripture and Tradition in Judaism: Haggadic Studies* published in 1961.[@vermes1961]

Prior to the mid-twentieth century, the prevailing approach to the study of haggadic exegesis was to treat the haggadah as originating with novel biblical interpretation made by individuals and focused primarily on texts which modern Judaism still considered authentic. As Vermes recounts, haggadic traditions were viewed as "the result of the adoption, and anonymous repetition, of popular interpretations by favourite preachers" [@vermes1961, 3]. Furthermore, the Tannaitic interpretations, dated from the second century CE (represented by Targums Onkelos and Jonathan) were considered the most ancient haggadic traditions. Thus a good number of ancient texts—apocrypha, pseudepigrapha, and sectarian texts—were excluded from discussions of the origins of haggadic exegesis.

A series of publications and discoveries beginning in the 1930's, however, began to undermine the notion that these early exegetical traditions began in the second century CE. Vermes credits this broadening of haggadic studies to a series of major studies and discoveries such as Rappaport's *Agada und Exegese bei Flavius Josephus*,[@rappaport1930] Paul Kahle's Schweich Lectures at the British Academy on the Cairo Geniza (given in 1941, published 1947),[@kahle1947] Kisch's new text edition of Ps. Philo's *Liber Antiquitatum Biblicarum* (1949),[@kisch1949] the discovery of the Dead Sea scrolls (1948) and Codex Neofiti (1956), as well as (and perhaps especially) Renée Bloch's work on midrash [@bloch1954; @bloch1955; translated and reedited as @bloch1955_repr; @vermes1961, 3--7]. The overarching theme among these works was the hard evidence for a methodological continuity between early interpretive traditions and later haggadah. For example, Vermes notes that Rappaport's work on *Jewish Antiquities* identified substantial overlaps between Josephus's text and  Rabbinic haggadah. He suggested, therefore, that Josephus had drawn from an already living tradition of interpretation. The implication of his suggestion is that the haggadah of the second century were not novel exegetical works, but were themselves products of earlier exegetical traditions.

According to Vermes's introduction, the explicitly stated purpose of the work, therefore, was to push the field beyond synchronic analysis of haggadah toward diachronic, historical analyses to trace the development of these exegetical traditions [@vermes1961, 1].

The first six chapters of the book offers a series of studies which bring various works of early jewish exegesis into conversation with later rabbinic traditions. In them Vermes surveys a number of biblical passages and themes alongside their varied post-biblical manifestations with the goal of tracing the historical evolution and interdependence (or, in some cases independence) of each tradition. Each study follows a somewhat formulaic pattern of synoptic presentation, explanation, and analysis, but each is meant to illustrate a particular aspect of the relationship between the earliest detectable interpretive traditions of the Hebrew Bible and the later traditions contained within the targums, haggadah, and midrashic materials.

The first three chapters of *Scripture and Tadition* make up Part I of Vermes's study, entitled, " The Symbolism of Words." In this section, Vermes focuses on the way that individual words and ideas take on localized symbolic meanings which are then applied globally to the interpretation of the Bible. In his first chapter, he notes the divergent treatment of Gen 44:18--19 among ancient commentators and proceeds through a synoptic study of this passage in the Fragmentary Targum, Targum Neofiti, and the Tosefta of Targum Yerushalmi. He concludes that the Fragmentary Targum represents the most primitive work, whose interpretive strategy is essentially inner-biblical (by harmonizing Gen 44 and 49 with Exod 7--9), followed by the Tosefta, which seems to depend on the Fragmentary Targum but takes a different interpretive stance, and finally Targum Neofiti, which combines the two. In this second chapter, Vermes examines the way that the word "Lebanon" came to be used symbolically in the Hebrew Bible and other jewish literature and how those symbolic meanings developed, particularly the association of Lebanon with Jerusalem and the Temple. He identifies the Song of Songs as the intermediary text which helped to establish this tradition within post-exilic Judaism, noting that the book occupies the unique position as the only biblical text which clearly uses the name Lebanon symbolically for the Temple. Importantly, Vermes shows that the symbolic use of Lebanon to represent Jerusalem and the Temple is rooted in *biblical* exegesis. This is a key idea for Vermes because it establishes a continuitty between the production of the biblical text and its later interpretation. In chapter three, Vermes examines other words which take on symbolic meaning in later Jewish texts ("lion," "Damascus," "*Meḥoqeq*," and "Man"), and shows the relative similarity of the process between the DSS texts and the targumic and midrashic materials.

It is in the second part of *Scripture and Tradition*  that the topic of  Rewritten Bible is addressed most directly. This section---titled "The Rewritten Bible"--- covers two chapters (chapters four and five), both focusing on the figure Abraham and the haggadic traditions surrounding his life.

In chapter four, Vermes embarks on what he calls a "retrogressive historical study" by which he means beginning with the traditions in their later, more developed forms, and working back toward their origins. In this case, Vermes begins with the 11th century CE text *Sefer ha-Yashar* (and the varied extra-biblical traditions contained therein) then works backward to identify sections of the text which exhibit earlier traditions, for example, in Targums, Josephus, Jubilees, (Ps.) Philo, and others. The purpose of this chapter is to demonstrate that even late texts can contain valuable information about earlier methods of exegesis. As Vermes puts it, "[Sefer ha-Yashar] manifests a direct continuity with the corresponding tradition of the time of the second Temple, but reflects also the influence of the haggadah of the Tannaim and Amoraim" [@vermes1961, 95].

In chapter five, Vermes proceeds with a "progressive historical study," by which he means a study beginning with the oldest materials and working forward. Still focusing on the figure Abraham, Vermes treats in detail the relationship between Gen 12:8--15:4 and cols. 19--22 of the Genesis Apocryphon. Vermes treats Genesis Apocryphon as "the most ancient midrash of all"[@vermes1961, 124] and views it as the "lost link between the biblical and the Rabbinic midrash" [@vermes1961, 124]. As I understand it, the Genesis Apocryphon, for Vermes, occupies a unique position just one step removed from inner-biblical exegesis. The task of GA's author was "to make the biblical story more attractive, more real, more edifying, and above all more intelligible" and he accomplishes this through a variety of means [@vermes1961, 125]. The work of the GA author, therefore, was to "[reconcile] unexplained or apparently conflicting statements in the biblical text in order to allay doubt and worry" [@vermes1961, 125]. According to Vermes, the interpretation of Genesis is "organically bound" to the text of Genesis and the additions that *were*  made sprung from the interpretation of the Bible itself and not whole-sale from the mind of the author [@vermes1961, 126]. Where texts like Jubliees sought to systematically advance a theological vision, according to Vermes, the author of GA intended to simply "explain the biblical text," calling it illustrative of "the unbiased rewriting of the Bible" [@vermes1961, 126].
