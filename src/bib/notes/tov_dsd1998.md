# Emmanuel Tov (1998)[@tov_dsd1998]

<!--Rewritten Bible Compositions and Biblical Manuscripts, with Special Attention to the Samaritan Pentateuch-->

Tov's purpose is to specify the "fine line between biblical manuscripts and rewritten Bible texts" [@tov_dsd1998, 334]. By this, Tov means that he is concerned with what I'm calling the "lower bound" of the definition of RwB, specifically, the distinction between a text *edition* and a distinct composition, which Tov considers "rewritten." The primary difference between these two categories of texts, according to Tov, is not how dramatically the daughter text diverges from its parent, but the *purpose* of the daughter text [@tov_dsd1998, 334]. According to Tov, this purpose is mirrored in the putatively authoritative status of the "biblical" text vis-a-vis the rewritten text which, he says, is not authoritative (although, he seems to suggest that this is up for debate[@tov_dsd1998, 337]).

For example, he notes that the extant texts of Jeremiah, while widely divergent in length and order, still represent "biblical Jeremiah" which carries some authoritative weight, though Tov is careful to point out that the nature of this authority is not clear and "the boundary between the biblical and non-biblical texts was probably not as fixed as we would have liked for the purpose of our scholarly analysis" [@tov_dsd1998, 335]. 

Tov doesn't really contribute all that much to the definition of the category, though he seems less preoccupied with a precise definition. In fact, after reading Tov, I'm now more in agreement with Bernstein that Tov's working definition is almost meaningless. It seems that if we include the SP under the rubric of RwB, then we ought to include the LXX and Targums, et al., and, indeed, I would agree with Bernstein that such a category is bordering on uselessâ€”really he's just talking about textual transmission, which RwB is, indeed, a part of.
