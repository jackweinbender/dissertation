# Rewritten Bible: A Generic Category Which Has Outlived Its Usefulness?

## Moshe Bernstein (2005)

For lack of a better term, Bernstein is a Vermesian conservative; he wants to maintain Vermes' narrow use of the term for fear of it losing its usefulness as a category. Notably, Bernstein never (as far as I'm concerned) clearly articulates what it means for a category to be "useful." All the same, he sets out to:

> "examine the definition and descriptions of "rewritten Bible" proffered by Vermes and several subsequent scholars, in order to delineate the variety of ways in which the term is currently employed and to make some suggestions for how we might use it more clearly and definitively in the future." [@171--172]

Bernstein begins by addressing the few small modifications that he makes to Vermes' list, namely that Bernstein does not understand the Targums to be examples of RwB. He excludes Targums from his discussion "*ab initio*," as well as "biblical" books, by which he seems to mean "Chronicles." Despite this second exclusion, Bernstein acknowledges that "One group's rewritten Bible could very well be another's biblical text!" [@175]. This seems particularly odd, since, and Ethiopian Christian may protest that Jubilees should be excluded as well. Bernstein concedes that "matters of canon and audience may play a role," but doesn't address the topic further. 

Bernstein critiques scholars such as Nicklesburg[@], Harrington[@], and Brooke[@] for excessively expanding the use of the term RwB at its "upper bound" (my term) to the point that they have weakened the term and have "not aided in focusing scholarly attention on the unifying vs. divergent traits of some of these early interpretive works" [@179]. Likewise, Bernstein critiques Tov for including reworked texts (e.g., 4QRP) and therefor expanding the "lower bound" of the category. While Bernstein  avers that "Rearrangement with the goal of interpretation is probably an earlier stage in the development of biblical 'commentary' than supplementation with the goal of interpretation," he nevertheless distinguishes the former from the category RwB and declares that "the definitions of 'rewritten Bible' furnished by Tov and Vermes are [not] even remotely compatible, and we need to choose between them simply for the purposes of clarity" [@185].

Bernstein, ultimately, argues that Vermes' category is worth keeping around, and admonishes the reader to maintain a narrow definition of the category, because, in his own words, "the more specific the implications of the term, the more valuable it is as a measuring device" [@195], and conversely that "the loser the definition, the less precisely it classifies those items under its rubric" [@195]. While his statement is true—almost axiomatically so—I am still left wondering what Bernstein sees as "at stake." In other words, "classification for *what?*" In what way should RwB texts (according to Bernstein's definition) be treated differently than, say, 1 Enoch? If we are not claiming that RwB was an acnient category, and we do not treat these texts differently than other, similar ancient texts (other than defining them as such), what value has been added? It seems to me that a process oriented definition, such as that of Harrington and Nickelsburg, is much more interesting and useful for describing and understanding ancient texts.
