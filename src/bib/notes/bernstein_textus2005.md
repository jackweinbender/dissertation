# Rewritten Bible: A Generic Category Which Has Outlived Its Usefulness?

## Moshe Bernstein (2005)

For lack of a better term, Bernstein is a Vermesian conservative; he wants to maintain Vermes' narrow use of the term for fear of it losing its usefulness as a category. Notably, Bernstein never (as far as I'm concerned) clearly articulates what it means for a category to be "useful." All the same, he sets out to:

> "examine the definition and descriptions of "rewritten Bible" proffered by Vermes and several subsequent scholars, in order to delineate the variety of ways in which the term is currently employed and to make some suggestions for how we might use it more clearly and definitively in the future." [@171--172]

Bernstein begins by addressing the few small modifications that he makes to Vermes' list, namely that Bernstein does not understand the Targums to be examples of RwB. He excludes Targums from his discussion "*ab initio*," as well as "biblical" books, by which he seems to mean "Chronicles." Despite this second exclusion, Bernstein acknowledges that "One group's rewritten Bible could very well be another's biblical text!" [@175]. This seems particularly odd, since, and Ethiopian Christian may protest that Jubilees should be excluded as well. Bernstein concedes that "matters of canon and audience may play a role," but doesn't address the topic further.
