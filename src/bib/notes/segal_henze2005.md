# Between Bible and Rewritten Bible

## Michael Segal (2005)

Segal seeks to enumerate a series of criteria by which scholars can distinguish between editions of biblical texts and so-called rewritten texts. He introduces a number of difficulties with making the distinction, not least among them is the relative fluidity of the biblical text(s) during the late second temple period. Broadly speaking, his goal is to delimit the "lower" boundary of the RwB phenomenon. That is to say, he wants to focus on the line between text edition, and new composition, rather than on the upper, or outer bound which defines, for example what is RwB and what is parabiblical (to use a later, poorly defined term).

Segal's understanding of the role of RwB is rooted in the conviction that:

>   "The dependence upon biblical compositions in the process of creating new works is a product of the author's desire to impute authority to his work; by associating his composition with the holiest of texts, the new work is also granted the same stamp of authority" [@11]

And further:

>   "the inclusion of this material within the framework of the biblical passages under interpretation transforms the ideas of the later writer into authoritative and accepted beliefs.... Even though these rewritten compositions sometimes contain material contradictory to their biblical sources, their inclusion within the existing framework of the biblical text bestows upon them legitimacy in the eyes of the intended audience" [@11]

And finally:

>   "The nature of the relationship between rewritten biblical compositions and their sources constitutes a paradox. On the one hand, the rewritten composition relies upon biblical texts for authority and legitimacy. The author claims that any new information included in the later work already appears in earlier sources. But simultaneously, the insertion of new ideas into the biblical text, ideas that may even contradict the beliefs and concepts of the original biblical authors, undermines the very authority that the rewriter hopes to utilize" [@11-12]

Segal's treatment of textual fluidity in the 2nd temple period is worth looking at, but for our purposes, it's not terribly relevant. Instead, I will focus on the characteristics of literature that he considers RwB vis-a-vis textual editions. He breaks up his criteria into "external" and "literary" (read: internal) characteristics.

### External Characteristics

 Segal's external characteristics are by far his weakest. He notes two external characteristics of RwB texts: "language" and "relationship between the source and its revision." 

#### Language

He doesn't mount much of an argument for language being categorically decisive, simply stating:

>   "On the simplest level, one can posit that any composition which presumes to present a copy of its source will be composed in the same language as its *Vorlage.* Thus, for most of the Bible, this limits the discussion to rewritten texts written in Hebrew." [@17]

Yet, by this criteria, he is able to excludes Josephus's *Antiquities* as well as the Genesis Apocryphon categorically, because they were not composed in Hebrew. He states:

>   "Although each of these works resembles other rewritten compositions from a literary perspective, the difference in language demarcates a clear line between them and their source" [@17--18]

I think Segal is needlessly undercutting himself here, unless he just doesn't want to deal with these "non Hebrew" texts. One might wonder that if a single criterion categorically excludes several texts which meet all the other criteria, perhaps the problem is with the criterion. In his discussions of other criteria, he begins by giving the principle by which the "edition" would assert itself as equal to its *Vorlage*, then contrast that with the RwB (see, esp. Expansion v. Abridgment). His reasoning is sound for a text edition (although I think the issue of textual authority and *translation* is, perhaps, too hastily ignored in this case), and could easily be contrasted with, for example the Genesis Apocryphon, which meets nearly all of his internal criteria.

#### The Textual Relationship between the Source and Its Revision,

His second characteristic [@18--19] is "the textual relationship between the Source and Its Revision," which is just a convoluted way of saying that you have to be able to "see" the *Vorlage* in the rewritten text. He uses the book of Chronicles as the parade example of this relationship and notes the caveats necessary in dealing with *Vorlagen* from this period (i.e., fluid texts == difficult to say what is 'rewritten' v. just another variant in the *Vorlage*).

Segal notes that both of these criteria, in fact, apply to textual editions, as well as to RwB texts [@20]. In other words, these are not "distinguishing" criteria, so much as the baseline for consideration. Again, I think the language criterion is flawed and unnecessary.

### Literary Criteria for "Rewritten Bible"

It is the "Literary Criteria" which Segal, ultimately, argues that provide the *definition* of RwB texts. He writes:

>   "It is precisely these characteristics, I submit, that define a rewritten composition as a new work and not merely as a further literary edition of the source" [@20].

Here again, Segal emphasizes that he is not identifying the *whole* scope of RwB, but is only concerned with what I've termed the "lower bound." Segal provides six criteria:

#### Scope of the Composition

Segal observes that "editions" (i.e. non-rewritten) of texts cover the same material as their source. In other words, one expects an edition of Genesis to cover the same material as the book of Genesis; pluses and minuses do not stray  into other works.

On the other hand, rewritten texts "do not generally correspond to the scope of their sources" [@20]. He writes:

>   "Chronicles presents parts of Samuel and Kings ; Jubilees rewrites Genesis--Exod 12; Pseudo-Philo's *Biblical Antiquities* begins with Adam and continues through David, but seems to be most interested in the period of the Judges. None of these works corresponds to any one biblical book, nor to any collection of works. ... In all these examples the change in the scope of the composition created a new literary unit." [@20--21]

#### New Narrative frame

Several of the RwB texts include a framing narrative. Segal writes, 

>   "This change places the composition as a while into a new setting and thus offers a new ideological framework by which to understand the text" [@21].

His examples include the Temple Scroll and Jubilees, both of which re-frame the "biblical" material. In the case of both works, the Torah is assumed and the new work presumed to be a reflection of a second, direct revelation of the law to Moses, albeit by different means (and fragmentary, in the case of the Temple Scroll). In Jubilees, the angel of the Presence revealed this "second Torah" during Moses' second ascent (Exod 24). On the other hand, the Temple scroll seems to have begun in Exod 34 [@22]. Both of these "additional" revelations are, therefore, rooted, according to Segal, in the biblical text. Thus, Segal makes the observation here that 

>   "at the same time, the author appeals to the authority of the Torah as it provides the evidence for this revelation" [@22]

#### Voice

While biblical narratives are generally written in a "detached" third person style, Segal observes that both Jubilees and the Temple Scroll "change the voice of the narrator throughout" [@22]. As far as I can tell, what Segal means is that in these RwB texts,  certain evens which are narrated in the third person in the biblical text are re-framed as, for instance, direct discourse in the first person by an angel, or even by God. This may seem like a minor quibble, but the "narrator" has a distinct and technical meaning in narrative criticism which should be maintained. I would note, however, that this sort of reframing is not unique to RwB, since, e.g., Deut does something similar. This is a weak criteria, in my mind.

#### Expansion versus Abridgment

Segal makes the observation that by-and-large, text editions are *additive*. That is to say, when there is a discrepancy between the amount of content (as opposed to the order), typically the shorter text is considered older. Segal is here concerned with editorial changes, and not with scribal errors, which, of course could go in both directions (through parablepsis et al.). This property, he contends, is rooted in the conviction of the scribes that in order to reproduce a text, one must reproduce the *entire* text. Segal writes:

>   "Once a scribe removed material, he could no longer claim he was preserving the same composition, because one can no longer identify the source within the revision" [@24]

Rewritten bible texts, however, felt free to add *or remove* material because they understood themselves to be composing an entirely new work. he writes:

>   "By definition, after a reviser has abridged, deleted, or disregarded entire sections, his new composition no longer contains the biblical source he reworked. In contrast to another edition of the same composition, a scribe who reduces his source makes no pretense of producing a text identified with or equal to it" [@24]

I find this to be an interesting criterion, but I wonder whether it may be importing too much from later conceptions of "the text." Furthermore, it seems like quite a statement to say that *all* ancient editions were *only* editorially expansive; there are far too little evidence in this article to sustain this position, even if it may be true.

#### Tendentious Editorial Layer

In differing editions of a text, according to Segal:

>   "The two editions of the same biblical composition do not change the basic ideological framework of the book" [@25]

Thus, differing editions of, say, Jeremiah may differ---even evince certain "tendencies" but those do not change the fundamental ideology of the work. Likewise, expansion and addition to the work (e.g. additions to Daniel) are in line with the theological *Tendenz* of the shorter book. On the other hand, regarding RwB texts, Segal writes:

>   "it is possible in almost every case to identify and describe the fundamental beliefs and concepts of the rewritten works. In many cases, these beliefs differ from those found in the biblical source undergoing revision" [@25]

#### Explicit References to the Source Composition

Finally, Segal notes that a work's allusion to its source text *by definition* sets apart. Conversely, a text edition *cannot* reference itself as a different text, obviously.

## Other Thoughts

Segal offers a good starting point, but a number of his criteria/characteristics require more thinking. One category of literature which I would have liked him to address is that of translations. Not only are translations a) by definition in a different language (cf. external factors), but they may evince b) a "tendentious editorial layer" (Esther) and c) explicit references to the source text (cf. Prologue to Sirach), as well .
