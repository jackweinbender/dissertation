# The Genesis Pseudepocryphon

**Pseutdepigrapohy participates in a discourse about "sources" differently than a plain rewriting**

This chapter will focus on the ways that the literary forms present in ~ga participated in both the transmission and construction of memory through biblical rewriting. I will focus on the figure Abram/Abraham, his portrayal in cols. 19--22, and the literary strategies utilized by the author of ~ga that participate in the construction of memory.

## Overview of ~ga

Brief lit. review and summary (structurem, dating, etc.); ~ga as ~rwb.

## Pseudepigraphy and Authoritative Sources

Discussion of pseudepigraphy as an "authorty conferign strategy", it's relationship to historical consiousness, and the way it is used in ~ga for Enoch, Lamech, and Abram. 

A part of this discussion needs to address the literary unity of the work and how "pseudepigraphy" may? operate within a narrative frame.

How does Pseudepigraphy interact with memory differently than other forms of literary rewriting?

## Keying and Framing Abram

Here I will engage with the related ideas of "keying" and "framing" as a way of thinking about the way(s) that Abram (and Noah and Lamech) are portrayed within the work as "visionaries", "healers", "sages", literate, etc. A special treatment of Abram as a "Jew in the court of a foreign king" will be useful.

How do these themes affect the "memory" of Abram (and Lamech and Enoch)

Framing Egyptians as love-song singers? Michael Fox's book on Egyptian love songs.

## Innerbiblical interpretation?

## Conclusions

Summarize the findings of the two sections. How does this move the conversation beyond ~ga as rewritten Bible?
