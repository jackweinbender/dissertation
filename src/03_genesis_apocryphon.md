# Genesis Pseudepocryphon

This chapter examines the ~ga through .... and it will do so by discussing the ~ga at three distinct levels of   discourse: structurally at the macro level as an example of pseudepigraphy, in terms of keying and framing at the level of narrative discourse, and finally from the perspective of biblical discourse.

## Pseudepigraphy and 1st Person Narrative

<!-- Hebrew Bible -->

The vast majority of the Hebrew Bible is narrated in the third-person omniscient. There are, of course, exceptions to this generalization, most notably within the prophetic corpus (such as Isa 6--8) and the so-called Nehemiah Memoir (Neh 11--13), but for the lion's share of the biblical text, the the implied author operates invisibly. The rhetorical force of this particular authorial voice, as observed by Erhard Blum, is significant for the function of the Hebrew Bible's participation in the collective memory of the communities that claim it as their own. Although the implied author does occasionally engage directly with the reader by offering explanatory observations (for example where the author inserts phrases like "this is why..." or "...until this day"), for all intents and purposes, the author presents himself as both *reliable* and *authoritative* without a hint of subjectivity. As Blum puts it, "In this sense the narrative does not distinguish the depiction from the depicted."[@blum_barton-etal2007, 33] Put another way, the text does not acknowledge that it *has* an author, it simply *is*. The rhetorical effect of this invisible, omniscient author is to collapse the knowledge gap between the reader and the events narrated  by removing the author from view. This move, according to Blum, allows the text to convey "an unmediated truth claim which is not based on the author's distinguishable critical judgments and convictions."[@blum_barton-etal2007, 33] The effectiveness of this implied author, according to Blum, is tied to the pragmatics of the text, that is, tied to the context of the biblical narratives as scripture (though, Blum does not refer to "scripture" *per se*). The implied audience of the biblical narratives by-and-large can be understood as group-insiders for whom the biblical text worked to reinforce group identity. Such "unmediated truth claims" *were* in fact mediated and reinforced by those who (orally or otherwise) transmitted the tradition from one generation to another.[@blum_barton-etal2007, 33] In other words, one might say that the voice of the biblical text is the voice of the collective memory.[Blum writes, "If we assume that the traditional literature was primarily transmitted through oral means, than the narrator who is speaking supplies the material with a personal presence; he is not present as an author who judges and evaluates his sources from a critical distance, but as a 'transmitter' who participates in the tradition itself and is able to lend it credence through his own personality, his standing, and/or his office." @blum_barton-etal2007, 33]

<!-- Genesis Apocryphon as Pseudepigraphy -->

In contrast to the omniscient implied biblical author, the ~ga frames itself as a collection of first-person accounts which formally fall into the category of pseudepigraphy. If we take seriously Blum's characterization of the way that the biblical text may have engaged with the collective memory of Israel based on the formal, narratological features of the text, it stands to reason that the ~ga as first-person pseudepigraphy would engage that collective memory in a different way despite the relative similarity of the textual content.

The extant material from ~ga is made up of a series of three (mostly) first-person narratives presented as texts written by the early biblical figures of Lamech, Noah, and Abram. Because the beginning and end of the scroll is missing, we do not have a way to determine whether some kind of framing narrative may have unified the first-person accounts of Lamech, Noah, and Abram or whether each account should be read as a standalone pseudepigraphical work. The beginning of both the Lamech and Abram accounts are missing, however, ~ga col. 5.29 seems to offer a superscription for the account of Noah, reconstructed as *[pršgn] ktb mly nwḥ* "[a copy of] the book of the words of Noah." This may suggest that the other first-person accounts, too, had such superscriptions. At the moment, however, the scholarly trends seem to point toward some kind of the authorial unity of ~ga  based on a number of shared terms and themes found throughout ~ga.[@bernstein_jbl2009] Regardless of whether or not ~ga was written as a single composition, we can at least affirm that each of the three first-person narrative accounts was *presented* by ~ga as independent, whether or not they actually were  "genuine" independent pseudepigraphical works.

<!-- Pseudepigraphy and Historical Consiousness -->

At this point we should take a moment to define the terms "pseudepigrapha" and "pseudepigraphy" because the terms carry different connotations depending on the contexts in which they are used. In discussions of early Christian canonical evaluations, "pseudepigrapha" refers to works which are *falsely* (read: deceptively) attributed to authoritative figures and were considered spurious by church leaders.[^pseud] On the other hand, in modern scholarly literature surrounding the Hebrew Bible, "pseudepigrapha" carries a more neutral connotation, but the formal criterion of false-ascription is often ignored.[To illustrate this imprecision, Bernstein makes the observation that although the first volume of James Charlesworth's *The Old Testament Pseudepigrapha* contains formally pseudepigraphic works, the second volume includes many which do not meet the formal definition of pseudepigrapha. @bernstein_chazon-etal1999, 2] For our purposes, "pseudepigrapha" and "pseudepigraphy" both will refer to works that were *written as though* they were composed by ancient figures but which were actually written by others at a much later time. I wish to emphasize the phrase *written as though* to distinguish between texts which *portray themselves* as composed by a particular figure and texts which are latter *attributed by others* to a figure. While the two phenomena are no doubt related, it is the act of writing in the name of another figure which interests me. <-- Come back to this at the end-->

[^pseud]: See esp. Hist. Eccl. 6.12.2 where the Bishop of Antioch, Serapion, refers to the * Gospel of Peter* among the a number of works "falsely attributed":  γάρ, ἀδελφοί, καὶ Πέτρον καὶ τοὺς ἄλλους ἀποστόλους ἀποδεχόμεθα ὡς Χριστόν, τὰ δὲ ὀνόματι αὐτῶν ψευδεπίγραφα ὡς ἔμπειροι παραιτούμεθα, γινώσκοντες ὅτι τὰ τοιαῦτα οὐ παρελάβομεν. "For we, brothers, accept both Peter and the other apostles as Christ, but we skillfully reject those falsely ascribed writings, knowing that they were not handed down to us."



<!-- Pseudepigraphy as a Framework of Memory -->

Approaching these questions from the perspective of Social Memory Studies requires us to think about the way that differing social frameworks and cognitive contexts may have allowed for or demanded presenting this material in a different form than its *Vorlage*.

One particularly compelling theory for the rise in first-person Pseudepigraphy  comes from Loren Stuckebruck
