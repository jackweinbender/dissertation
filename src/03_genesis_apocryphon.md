# Genesis Pseudepocryphon

This chapter examines the ~ga through .... and it will do so by discussing the ~ga at three distinct levels of   discourse: structurally at the macro level as an example of pseudepigraphy, in terms of keying and framing at the level of narrative discourse, and finally from the perspective of biblical discourse.

## Pseudepigraphy and 1st Person Narrative

One of the most striking features of the ~ga when compared to other ~rwb texts is its pervasive use of the first-person voice to narrate the events of the story. 
<!-- Made up of three distinct stories -->
Although the literary unity of the work has been advocated by noted scholars such as Moshe Bernstein, formally, ~ga is made up of what appears to be three discrete narrative units.[@bernstein_jbl2009]  Each section is presented as a first-person recounting of biblical events by a notable figure from within the biblical story: first Lamech, then Noah, then Abram. Although the beginnings of the Lamech and Abram accounts were lost to damage to the scroll, col. 5.29 seems to offer a superscription for the account of Noah, reconstructed as *[pršgn] ktb mly nwḥ* "[a copy of] the book of the words of Noah." 

<!-- Problematize the above observations -->
Based on this superscription, it is reasonable to suppose that the accounts of Lamech and Abram, too, had such superscriptions, although at least two complicating factors should be taken into account. 
<!-- Framing Narrative? -->
First, while the extant portions of ~ga present themselves as distinct units, both the very beginning and the very end of the scroll have been lost. From a structural standpoint, this fact should elicit caution because it is at the beginning and end of texts where such features as "framing narratives" and other explanatory material is often located. Without definitive evidence of the presence or absence of such features one must be extra cautious when making observations about the rhetorical purpose of the macro-structure of a particular text. 
<!-- Aren't consistently first-person -->
Second, although all three accounts are *generally* written in the first-person, none of them are rigorously committed to maintaining the voice. As Loren Stuckenbruck notes, each of the three "documents," at one point or another, falls into some kind of third-person voice: Lamech in 5.24-25, Noah in 16.14-17.19, and Abram in 21.23-22.34. Stuckenbruck also puts the superscription of the "book of the words of Noah" into this category. This is a good example of how the macro-structure of the work is important for this kind of analysis. By treating the superscription as a contribution of the "author" of a unified ~ga, Stuckenbruck understands the superscription to be "in the third person" and would (apparently) treat each first-person account as an embedded narrative within a larger framing narrative (of which the superscription would be a part). For example, if the beginning of the scroll gave a brief framing narrative, describing a young man who discovered three scrolls in the desert and thus proceeded to provide "a copy of the book of the words of X," Stuckenbruck would be absolutely correct. However, if one understands the superscription to be an editorial insertion, it does not make sense to include it as an example of third-person discourse for the same reasons it does not make sense to say that Ps 23 uses third-person discourse by beginning with *mizmôr lə-dāwid*.[@stuckenbruck_roitman-etal2011, 315--316; See also @bernstein_chazon-etal1999, 15--16. Even supposing a single author for ~ga, as Stuckenbruck and others imply, I am still inclined to consider the superscriptions separately from the former examples because they would exist outside the frame of each embedded narrative.]

<!-- Hebrew Bible -->

The vast majority of the Hebrew Bible is narrated in the third-person omniscient. There are, of course, exceptions to this generalization, most notably within the prophetic corpus (such as Isa 6--8) and the so-called Nehemiah Memoir (Neh 11--13), but for the lion's share of the biblical text, the the implied author operates invisibly. Here I have adopted the definition of "implied author" from H. Porter Abbott: 

> Neither the real *author* nor the *narrator*, the implied author is the idea of the author constructed by the reader as she or he reads the *narrative*. In an *intentional reading*, the implied author is that sensibility and moral intelligence that the reader gradually constructs to infer the intended meanings and effects of the narrative. The implied author might as easily (and with greater justice) be called the "inferred author" [@abbott2008, 235]

The rhetorical force of this particular authorial voice, as observed by Erhard Blum, is significant for the function of the Hebrew Bible's participation in the collective memory of the communities that claim it as their own. Although the implied author does occasionally engage directly with the reader by offering explanatory observations (for example where the author inserts phrases like "this is why..." or "...until this day"), for all intents and purposes, the implied author presents as both *reliable* and *authoritative* without a hint of subjectivity. As Blum puts it, "In this sense the narrative does not distinguish the depiction from the depicted."[@blum_barton-etal2007, 33] Put another way, the text does not acknowledge that it *has* an author, it simply *is*. The rhetorical effect of this invisible, omniscient author is to collapse the knowledge gap between the reader and the events narrated  by removing the author from view. This move, according to Blum, allows the text to convey "an unmediated truth claim which is not based on the author's distinguishable critical judgments and convictions."[@blum_barton-etal2007, 33] The effectiveness of this implied author, according to Blum, is tied to the pragmatics of the text, that is, tied to the context of the biblical narratives as scripture (though, Blum does not refer to "scripture" *per se*). The implied audience of the biblical narratives by-and-large can be understood as group-insiders for whom the biblical text worked to reinforce group identity. Such "unmediated truth claims" *were* in fact mediated and reinforced by those who (orally or otherwise) transmitted the tradition from one generation to another.[@blum_barton-etal2007, 33] In other words, one might say that the implied author of the biblical text is the community's collective memory.[Blum writes, "If we assume that the traditional literature was primarily transmitted through oral means, than the narrator who is speaking supplies the material with a personal presence; he is not present as an author who judges and evaluates his sources from a critical distance, but as a 'transmitter' who participates in the tradition itself and is able to lend it credence through his own personality, his standing, and/or his office." @blum_barton-etal2007, 33]

<!-- Genesis Apocryphon as Pseudepigraphy -->

In contrast to the omniscient implied biblical author, the ~ga frames itself as a collection of first-person accounts which formally fall into the category of pseudepigraphy. If we take seriously Blum's characterization of the way that the biblical text may have engaged with the collective memory of Israel based on the formal, narratological features of the text, it stands to reason that the ~ga as first-person pseudepigraphy would engage that collective memory in a different way despite the relative similarity of the textual content.



<!-- Pseudepigraphy and Historical Consiousness -->

At this point we should take a moment to define the terms "pseudepigrapha" and "pseudepigraphy" because the terms carry different connotations depending on the contexts in which they are used. In discussions of early Christian canonical evaluations, "pseudepigrapha" refers to works which are *falsely* (read: deceptively) attributed to authoritative figures and were considered spurious by church leaders.[^pseud] On the other hand, in modern scholarly literature surrounding the Hebrew Bible, "pseudepigrapha" carries a more neutral connotation, but the formal criterion of false-ascription is often ignored.[To illustrate this imprecision, Bernstein makes the observation that although the first volume of James Charlesworth's *The Old Testament Pseudepigrapha* contains formally pseudepigraphic works, the second volume includes many which do not meet the formal definition of pseudepigrapha. @bernstein_chazon-etal1999, 2] For our purposes, "pseudepigrapha" and "pseudepigraphy" both will refer to works that were *written as though* they were composed by ancient figures but which were actually written by others at a much later time. I wish to emphasize the phrase *written as though* to distinguish between texts which *portray themselves* as composed by a particular figure and texts which are latter *attributed by others* to a figure. While the two phenomena are no doubt related, it is the act of writing in the name of another figure which interests me. <-- Come back to this at the end-->

[^pseud]: See esp. Hist. Eccl. 6.12.2 where the Bishop of Antioch, Serapion, refers to the * Gospel of Peter* among the a number of works "falsely attributed":  γάρ, ἀδελφοί, καὶ Πέτρον καὶ τοὺς ἄλλους ἀποστόλους ἀποδεχόμεθα ὡς Χριστόν, τὰ δὲ ὀνόματι αὐτῶν ψευδεπίγραφα ὡς ἔμπειροι παραιτούμεθα, γινώσκοντες ὅτι τὰ τοιαῦτα οὐ παρελάβομεν. "For we, brothers, accept both Peter and the other apostles as Christ, but we skillfully reject those falsely ascribed writings, knowing that they were not handed down to us."



<!-- Pseudepigraphy as a Framework of Memory -->

Approaching these questions from the perspective of Social Memory Studies asks us to think about the way that differing social frameworks and cognitive contexts may have allowed for or demanded presenting this material in a different form than its *Vorlage*.

One of the difficulties in dealing with pseudepigraphy is the apparently divergent ways that the authors and original readers may have understood pseudepigraphy as compared to the way that later groups (e.g., Church Fathers, modern scholars) treat it. The crux of the issue, it seems to me, is less to do with whether the author intended to "deceive" his audience, and more to do with whether the readers understood themselves to be reading something "authentic" or were willing participants in an authorial fiction. Yet, even language of "authenticity" or "fiction" presupposes that such terms were a meaningful part of the discourse surrounding "scripture" during the late ~2T period.
