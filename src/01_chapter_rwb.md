# The ~RwB


## Emergence of the Concept of ~rwb
In his seminal work ~stj-full, Geza Vermes introduced the term "~rwB" to the discussion of Second Temple Jewish literature to describe an exegetical process by which "the midrashist inserts haggadic development into the biblical narrative" in order to "anticipate questions, and to solve problems in advance."[@vermes1961, 95; see also @vermes_zsengeller2014] The authors of these texts, therefore, make use of *implicitly* those interpretive traditions which later exegetical texts make *explicit*.

### Scripture and Tradition in Judaism (1961)
The primary purpose of *Scripture and Tradition*, however, was not to offer a clear definition of the term "~rwB," but to lay the groundwork for the historical, diachronic, study of aggadic traditions, of which ~rwB makes only a small part.[@vermes_zsengeller2014, 3] As Vermes recounts, prior to the mid-twentieth century, the prevailing approach to the study of aggadic exegesis was to treat the aggadah as originating during the Tannaitic period.  The aggadah were viewed as "the result of the adoption, and anonymous repetition, of popular interpretations by favourite preachers," [@vermes1961, 3] the earliest of which were from the second century CE and were represented by Targums Onkelos and Jonathan. Furthermore, studies of ancient Jewish literature at this time focused on texts which modern Judaism considered authentic. As a result, a good number of earlier texts---for example, the apocrypha, pseudepigrapha, and sectarian texts---were often categorically excluded from discussions of the origins of aggadic exegesis.[@vermes1961, 2]

A series of publications and discoveries beginning in the 1930's, however, began to undermine the notion that these early exegetical traditions began in the second century CE. Vermes credits this broadening of aggadic studies to a series of major studies and discoveries such as Rappaport's *Agada und Exegese bei Flavius Josephus*,[@rappaport1930] Paul Kahle's Schweich Lectures at the British Academy on the Cairo Geniza (given in 1941, published 1947),[@kahle1947] Kisch's new text edition of Ps. Philo's ~lab (1949),[@kisch1949] the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls (1948) and Codex Neofiti (1956), as well as (and perhaps especially) Renée Bloch's work on midrash [@bloch1954; @bloch1955_repr; @vermes1961, 3--7]. The overarching theme among these works was the evidence for continuity between biblical interpretive traditions prior to the second century, and later aggadah. For example, Vermes notes that Rappaport's work on ~ant identified substantial overlaps between Josephus's text and Rabbinic aggadah and suggested, therefore, that Josephus had drawn from an already living tradition of interpretation. The implication of his suggestion is that the aggadah of the second century were not novel exegetical works, but were themselves products of earlier exegetical traditions.

Building on these recent advancements, the explicitly stated purpose of *Scripture and Tradition* was to push the field beyond synchronic analysis of haggadah toward diachronic, historical analyses to trace the development of these exegetical traditions [@vermes1961, 1; See also @bloch1955_repr]. The book is eight chapters long and is divided into four parts.

The first three chapters of *Scripture and Tadition* make up the first part of Vermes's study and is entitled " The Symbolism of Words." In this section, Vermes focuses on the way that individual words and ideas take on localized symbolic meanings which are then applied globally to the interpretation of the Bible. In his first chapter, he notes the divergent treatment of Gen 44:18--19 among ancient commentators and proceeds through a synoptic study of this passage in the Fragmentary Targum, Targum Neofiti, and the Tosefta of Targum Yerushalmi. He concludes that the Fragmentary Targum represents the most primitive work, whose interpretive strategy is essentially inner-biblical (by harmonizing Gen 44 and 49 with Exod 7--9), followed by the Tosefta, which seems to depend on the Fragmentary Targum but takes a different interpretive stance, and finally Targum Neofiti, which combines the two. In this second chapter, Vermes examines the way that the word "Lebanon" came to be used symbolically in the Hebrew Bible and other jewish literature and how those symbolic meanings developed, particularly the association of Lebanon with Jerusalem and the Temple. He identifies the Song of Songs as the intermediary text which helped to establish this tradition within post-exilic Judaism, noting that the book occupies the unique position as the only biblical text which clearly uses the name Lebanon symbolically for the Temple. Importantly, Vermes shows that the symbolic use of Lebanon to represent Jerusalem and the Temple is rooted in *biblical* exegesis. This is a key idea for Vermes because it establishes a continuity between the production of the biblical text and its later interpretation. In chapter three, Vermes examines other words which take on symbolic meaning in later Jewish texts ("lion," "Damascus," "*Meḥoqeq*," and "Man"), and shows the relative similarity of the process between the DSS texts and the targumic and midrashic materials.

It is in the second part of *Scripture and Tradition*  that the topic of  ~RwB is addressed most directly. This section---titled "The ~RwB"--- covers two chapters (chapters four and five), both focusing on the figure Abraham and the aggadic traditions surrounding his life.

In chapter four, Vermes embarks on what he calls a "retrogressive historical study" by which he means beginning with the traditions in their later, more developed forms, and working back toward their origins. In this case, Vermes begins with the 11th century CE text *Sefer ha-Yashar* (and the varied extra-biblical traditions contained therein) then works backward to identify sections of the text which exhibit earlier traditions, for example, in Targums, Josephus, Jubilees, (Ps.) Philo, and others. The purpose of this chapter is to demonstrate that even late texts can contain valuable information about earlier methods of exegesis. As Vermes puts it, "[Sefer ha-Yashar] manifests a direct continuity with the corresponding tradition of the time of the second Temple, but reflects also the influence of the haggadah of the Tannaim and Amoraim."[@vermes1961, 95]

In chapter five, Vermes proceeds with a "progressive historical study," by which he means a study beginning with the oldest materials and working forward. Still focusing on the figure Abraham, Vermes treats in detail the relationship between Gen 12:8--15:4 and cols. 19--22 of the ~ga. Vermes treats ~ga as "the most ancient midrash of all"[@vermes1961, 124] and views it as the "lost link between the biblical and the Rabbinic midrash" [@vermes1961, 124]. As I understand it, the ~ga, for Vermes, occupies a unique position just one step removed from inner-biblical exegesis. The task of ~ga's author was "to make the biblical story more attractive, more real, more edifying, and above all more intelligible" and he accomplishes this through a variety of means [@vermes1961, 125]. The work of ~ga's author, therefore, was to "[reconcile] unexplained or apparently conflicting statements in the biblical text in order to allay doubt and worry."[@vermes1961, 125] According to Vermes, the interpretation of Genesis is "organically bound" to the text of Genesis and the additions that *were*  made sprung from the interpretation of the Bible itself and not whole-sale from the mind of the author [@vermes1961, 126]. Where texts like Jubliees sought to systematically advance a theological vision, according to Vermes, the author of ~ga intended to simply "explain the biblical text," calling it illustrative of "the unbiased rewriting of the Bible."[@vermes1961, 126]

The final two chapters make up the final section, titled "Theology and Exegesis" and push the discussion to include early Christianity. Chapter seven is entitled "Circumcision and Exodus 4:24--26" but offers a subtitle of "Prelude to the Theology of Baptism," which gives some hint at the ultimate, if tacit, goal of the chapter. Discussing the topic of circumcision in Ex 4:24--26 and its treatment among the early exegetes, Vermes's primary observation is simply that the theology of circumcision and the exegetical traditions which surrounded it, were affected by historical forces and theological ideologies. For instance, he claims that Jubilees omitted the rather odd statement that God was going to kill Moses---who was saved by the circumcision of his son by Zipporah---because "It was impossible for its author to accept that God tried to kill Moses as it was for him to believe that Moses neglected to circumcise his son on the eighth day after his birth."[@vermes1961, 185] Similarly, he notes that after the Bar Kokhba rebellion, the practice of circumcision was outlawed and so, "it is not surprising, therefore, to find the spiritual authorities of Palestinian Judaism emphasizing the greatness and necessity of this essential rite, and explaining away ... every possible biblical excuse for delaying the circumcision of their children."[@vermes1961, 189] He ends the chapter by suggesting that the early Christian association of baptism with circumcision (citing Rom 4:3--4 and Col 2:11--12) was enabled by the traditional Jewish association of circumcision withe blood sacrifice ("the Blood of the Covenant")[@vermes1961, 190]. That Paul (to whom he attributes both Romans and Colossians) associated baptism with circumcision therefore, was "not due, therefore, to his own insight, but springs directly from the contemporary Jewish doctrine of circumcision which he adopted and adapted."[@vermes1961, 191]

Vermes makes a similar move in chapter eight, entitled "Redemption and Genesis XXII: The Binding of Isaac and the Sacrifice of Jesus." In it, he compares a number of ancient works' treatment of the Aqedah and demonstrates how the (near-) sacrifice of Isaac became a prototype for the entire sacrificial system in later judaism. The sacrifice of animals in the Temple functioned as a "reminder" to God of the faithfulness of Abraham. Furthermore, he shows the ways the tradition grew to focus on the willingness of Isaac to be sacrificed and his function as a proto-matryr. Thus, he ends the chapter by addressing the New Testament's portrayal of Jesus as a willing sacrifice to God and its putative relationship to the Aqedah. Vermes makes the case that the redemptive theology of the NT---typically attributed to Paul---was not original to him. He writes:

> For although [Paul] is undoubtedly the greatest theologian of the Redemption, he worked with inherited materials and among these was, by his own confession, the tradition that "Christ dies for us according to the Scriptures."[@vermes1961, 221]

He then proceeds to push the origin of this theology back further into the first century CE, and, in rather dramatic fashion, suggests that the introduction of the Aqedah motif into Christian theology---by means of the Suffering Servant---may have been by Jesus himself [@vermes1961, 223].

He concludes the chapter by discussing the Aqedah and the Eucharist. Just as the whole sacrificial system pointed back toward the binding of Isaac in targumic exegesis, the eucharistic rite likewise was intended---according to Vermes---to point back to Jesus's redemptive sacrifice. Thus he concludes:

> Although it would be inexact to hold that the Eucharistic doctrine of the New Testament, together with the whole Christian doctrine of Redemption, is nothing but a Christian version of the Jewish Akedah theology, it is nevertheless true that in the formation of this doctrine the targumic representation of the Binding of Isaac has played an essential role.

> Indeed, without the help of Jewish exegesis it is impossible to perceive any Christian teaching in its true perspective.[@vermes1961, 227]

The arc of Vermes's study, therefore, is meant to establish a continuity between the earliest traditions of biblical interpretation with the later traditions of both Rabbinic Judaism and Early Christianity and to trace the evolution of those traditions historically.

### Vermes's Use of ~RwB
The fact that Vermes spent so little time explaining precisely what he meant by the term ~rwb bears witness to the fact that Vermes thought the term was rather self-explanatory. Vermes makes this sentiment clear in his short retrospective on the origins of the term, expressing shock over the debate that his term prompted and the scholarly confusion surrounding it. He writes:

> The notion [of ~rwb], which over fifty years ago I thought was quite clear, seemed to the majority of the more recent practitioners nebulous and confused, and lacked methodological precision.[@vermes_zsengeller2014, 3]

Only a few scholars, according to Vermes, managed to remain true to his original vision.^[He specifically references @alexander_carson-williamson1988 and @bernstein_textus2005.] Instead, many subsequent studies, according to Vermes, "moved the goalposts" to better "suit the interest of their inquiry."[@vermes_zsengeller2014, 4]

## Genre and Process
One of the central issues with the term ~RwB is whether it should be treated as a "genre" or as a "process" or "activity."  Because these texts eluded categorization within traditional established text groups such as Targums, or midrash, early treatment of ~rwb as a discrete group was not unreasonable. Although scholars such as Daniel Harrington, argued against the treatment of ~rwb as a generic category quite early,[@harrington_kraft-nickelsburg1986] a number of scholars have since argued the reverse.

The parade example of this perspective is Philip Alexander's 1988 article "Retelling the Old Testament," which, although dated, remains the most widely cited exemplar of the "genre" perspective.[@alexander_carson-williamson1988] Alexander takes up four ~rwB texts (~jub, ~ga, ~lab, and ~ant) to determine whether there exists a set of concrete criteria by which scholars can admit or exclude text from the category. Although I ultimately disagree with his conclusion that ~rwb should be treated as a literary genre, his list of nine "principle characteristics" make a number of useful observations about the nature of ~rwb texts generally and are summarized as follows:

1. ~rwb texts are *narratives* which follow the order of the biblical text.
2. ~rwb texts are "free standing" literary works that take on the same form as the text they rewrite. They do not comment explicitly on their *Vorlagen*, but weave interpretation into their seamless retelling.
3. ~rwb texts are not meant to replace the biblical work.
4. ~rwb texts cover a large portion of the biblical narrative and exhibit a "centripetal" relationship to the biblical text.
5. ~rwb texts follow the biblical text's narrative ordering, but may omit certain, non-essential elements.
6. ~rwb texts offer an interpretive reading of scripture which, quoting Vermes offer, "a fuller, smoother and doctrinally more advanced form of the sacred narrative"[Citing Vermes in @schurer1986, 305] and implicitly comment on the biblical text.
7. ~rwb texts are limited by their literary form which only allows a single interpretation of the biblical text that they rewrite.
8. ~rwb texts are limited by their literary form which does not allow them to explain their exegetical rationale.
9. ~rwb texts incorporate traditions and material not derived from the biblical text.

Despite Alexander's emphatic conclusion affirming the genre of ~RwB, a few of these criteria are unconvincing. While Vermes, too, affirmed that one characteristic of ~rwb was only a narrative phenomenon,[vermes GET THIS] texts such as the Temple Scroll q[11QT^a^] have caused some, such as Bernstein, to call this conclusion into question.[@bernstein_textus2005] This caveat illustrates one of the major shortcomings in Alexander's method, specifically, that his conclusions were based on four texts "normally included in the genre."[@alexander_carson-williamson1988, 99] Alexander insists that "Any text admitted to the genre must display *all* the characteristics,"[@alexander_carson-williamson1988, 119 n. 11] but he offers no formal rationale for selecting his sample and so his conclusions suffer from a sort of selection bias. The texts that he selects, indeed, represent the *core* of what is generally accepted to be ~rwb, but texts on the periphery of a genre, almost by definition, will not display *every* characteristic of the core texts. Thus the criteria that Alexander proposes should not be treated as prerequisites for inclusion to the category of RwB, but as attributes of a sort of literary *Idealtypus*.

Alexander's third criteria also suffers
