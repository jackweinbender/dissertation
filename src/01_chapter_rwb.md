# The Rewritten Bible


## Emergence of the Concept of RwB
In his seminal work *Scritpure and Tradition in Judaism: Haggadic Studies*, Geza Vermes introduced the term "rewritten Bible" to the discussion of Second Temple Jewish literature as an exegetical process by which "the midrashist inserts haggadic development into the biblical narrative" in order to "anticipate questions, and to solve problems in advance."[@vermes1961, 95] The primary purpose of the *Scritpure and Tradition*, however, was not to offer a clear definition of the term "rewritten Bible," but to lay the groundwork for the historical, diachronic, study of aggadic traditions, of which rewritten Bible makes only a small part.
