# The Rewritten Bible


## Emergence of the Concept of RwB
In his seminal work *Scritpure and Tradition in Judaism: Haggadic Studies*, Geza Vermes introduced the term "rewritten Bible" to the discussion of Second Temple Jewish literature to describe an exegetical process by which "the midrashist inserts haggadic development into the biblical narrative" in order to "anticipate questions, and to solve problems in advance."[@vermes1961, 95] The authors of these texts, therefore, make use of *implicitly* those interpretive traditions which later exegetical texts make *explicit*.

The primary purpose of *Scritpure and Tradition*, however, was not to offer a clear definition of the term "rewritten Bible," but to lay the groundwork for the historical, diachronic, study of aggadic traditions, of which rewritten Bible makes only a small part. As Vermes recounts, prior to the mid-twentieth century, the prevailing approach to the study of aggadic exegesis was to treat the aggadah as originating during the Tannaitic period.  The aggadah were viewed as "the result of the adoption, and anonymous repetition, of popular interpretations by favourite preachers," [@vermes1961, 3] the earliest of which were from the second century CE and were represented by Targums Onkelos and Jonathan. Furthermore, most studies focused on texts which modern Judaism considered authentic, thus, a good number of earlier texts---for example, the apocrypha, pseudepigrapha, and sectarian texts---were often categorically excluded from discussions of the origins of aggadic exegesis.[@vermes1961, ]
