\chapter{Social Memory Studies and the
Rewritten Bible}\label{social-memory-studies-and-the-rwb}}

The past several decades, beginning in the late 1970's, a dramatic
increase in scholarly interest toward the topic of ``memory'' has swept
throughout the social sciences. The precipitous rise in scholarly
literature dealing with topics of memory coupled with its proliferation
in popular media discourses has prompted some in the field to refer to
the ``memory industry'' and to describe the ubiquity of memory
discourses as a ``boom'' fast-approaching a
bust.\autocites{rosenfeld_jmh2009}{winter2006}{berliner_aq2005} Yet, as
Olick et al.~make very clear in their Introduction to \emph{The
Collective Memory Reader}, there remain a significant number of scholars
throughout the social sciences who continue to find ``memory'' to a
useful heuristic and a compelling theoretical basis for their various
and sundry analytical applications.\autocite[3--6]{olick_olick-etal2011}

Although the topic of ``memory'' has been of interest philosophers and
thinkers since the ancient Greeks, as Olick and Robbins note, the modern
social-scientific approaches which concern this chapter almost
exclusively trace their genealogy to the early 20th century work of
sociologist Maurice Halbwachs.\autocites[106]{olick-robbins_ars1998}[It
should be noted, however, that Halbwachs was not the first or only
person to do work on memory or the impact of society thereon, despite
most recent literature's preoccupation with him,
see][8--36]{olick_olick-etal2011} Although Halbwachs's work was not
limited to exploring the topic of social memory (he also made
contributions to statictics and probability theory, as well as
sociological work on the topic of suicide and social
morphology\autocite[13--20]{coser_halbwachs1992}), his work in this area
has managed to endure and continues to find new applications and to
inspire new approaches in ways that his other contributions have not.

\section{The Work of Maurice Halbwachs: A Very Brief
Overview}\label{the-work-of-maurice-halbwachs-a-very-brief-overview}}

Halbwachs published three primary works on the topic of memory, the
first of which appeared in 1925 under the title \emph{The Social
Frameworks of Memory}.\autocite{halbwachs1925} This monograph, along
with a short essay dealing with the remembered geography the Holy Land,
entitled \emph{The Legendary Topography of the Holy
Land}\autocite{halbwachs1941} was excerpted and translated by Lewis
Coser in a single volume under the title \emph{On Collective Memory} in
1992.\autocite[Several of the most important chapters of \emph{The
Social Frameworks of Memory} were included in full. Likewise, the
entirety of the conclusion of \emph{The Legendary Topography} was
included][]{halbwachs1992} His final contribution, entitled \emph{The
Collective Memory}, was published posthumously in 1950 and translated
into English in 1980 with an editorial introduction by Mary
Douglas.\autocite{halbwachs1980} This work simultaneously represents
some of Halbwachs's most developed ideas (responding to critics such as
Charles Blondel) and evinces an incompleteness which posthumous
publications often suffer. As Coser observes, ``One may doubt that the
author himself would have been willing to publish it in what seems to be
an unfinished state. The book nevertheless contains many further
developments of Halbwachs's thought in regard to such matters as the
relation of space and time to collective memory as well as fruitful
definitions and applications of the differences between individual,
collective, and historical memory.''\autocite{coser_halbwachs1992}

The central contribution of Halbwachs's work was the notion that human
memory is intrinsically and inextricably tied to social frameworks.
Humans are social beings and as such human processes, such as memory,
can only be completed within the context of a society. This focus on the
\emph{social} dimensions of memory betrays the deep influence that Émile
Durkheim's work had on Halbwachs. Unlike Durkheim, however, Halbwachs's
approach was tempered by his desire to identify the physical (or,
perhaps ``biological'') location of memory within the individual.
Although the term ``collective memory'' evokes an ethereal or
metaphysical idea, Halbwachs's use of the term is entirely concrete.
Individual memories are kept by \emph{individuals}. However, an
individual's ability to retrieve and utilize a particular memory is
intrinsically tied to the individual's social context. Memories require
social frameworks to function.\autocite[38]{halbwachs1992}

To illustrate this point, Halbwachs begins \emph{The Social Frameworks
of Memory} by attempting to prove the negative. \emph{Without} a social
framework, he argues, memories are always incomplete. Because
humans---for all intents and purposes---always exist within a society,
it is the dream state, he avers, that most closely approximates the
complete isolation of memory from society. Therefor the way that the
human brain deals with memories while dreaming can illustrate the
(dis)function of memories lacking a social framework. Thus, he observes
that ``dreams are composed of fragments of memory too mutilated and
mixed up with others to allow us to recognize them.'' Because in dream
states the mind lacks the ability to ``check'' itself against anything
external to itself, dreams do not contain ``true
memories.''\autocite[41]{halbwachs1992} This assertion is set against
the ``purely individual psychology'',\autocites[E.g., Bergson, and
Freud.
See][]{ansellpearson_radstone-schwarz2011}[and][]{terdiman_radstone-schwarz2011}
which viewed \emph{memory} as a location of social isolation. Regarding
the incompleteness of the dream state, he writes:

\begin{quote}
Almost completely detached from the system of social representations,
{[}the dream state's{]} images are nothing more than raw materials,
capable of entering into all sorts of combinations. They establish only
random relations among each other---relations based on the disordered
play of corporal modification.\autocite[42]{halbwachs1992}
\end{quote}

The ``system of social representations'' that Halbwachs refers to is not
limited, however, to macro structures such as familial, religious, or
class groups. Although these structures certainly \emph{do} make up an
important stratum of social frameworks, Halbwachs envisions something
much more fundamental which betrays his broadly structuralist
perspective. Halbwachs uses the phrase ``social representations'' to
refer to a system of shared ``signs'' that encompassed not only
language, but every aspect of a group's social framework---a sort of
``cultural \emph{langue}.'' Although, Halbwachs does not use the
language of semiotics, the analogy is helpful. Just as Saussurian
linguistics argues that the concrete arbitrary sign is given meaning
only by participating in the broader, shared \emph{langue}, so too
memories (read: ``signs'') require a framework to convey meaning, as do
the concrete, individual expressions of remembrance (read:
\emph{parole}). Halbwachs writes:

\begin{quote}
It is in this sense that there exists a collective memory and social
frameworks for memory; it is to the degree that our individual thought
places itself in these frameworks and participates in this memory that
it is capable of the act of recollection.\autocite[PAGE]{halbwachs1992}.
\end{quote}

Memories, therefore, cannot be understood in isolation from their social
framework and therefore should not be analyzed without consideration to
the social context of the rememberer.

Of course, people participate in a plurality of social groups, often
simultaneously, and the experiences that are later to be recalled, too,
must be situated within these frameworks. In order to bring these
autobiographical memories to mind, according to Halbwachs, an individual
attempts to mentally situate herself within those same frameworks. For
instance, I find it much easier to recall whether a particular course I
have taken occurred in the Fall or Spring semester, rather than which
month or even year it occurred. The social framework that is the
``academic year'' remains a potent framework for my own memories, while
my wife---who had the good sense to stop after one degree---stopped
remembering in terms of ``semesters'' years ago. Yet, when remembering
events during her time at the University, the semester once again
becomes a useful framework for memory. It is for this reason that recent
memories are more easy to call to mind: because the social frameworks
that produced the memory (the people, places, customs, etc.) remain in
close proximity for the rememberer and the effort required to situate
the memory within the social frameworks that produced it is
minimal.\autocite[52]{halbwachs1992}

This overview is representative of his central thesis and provides a
point of departure for his more in-depth studies of collective memory in
the family, religion, and social classes. Thus, by ``social'' memory,
Halbwachs refers to individual memory and how it is recalled within
externally defined social frameworks, i.e.~how society provides the
framework that makes individual memory
possible.\autocite[180]{hubenthal_carstens-hasselbalch2012} On the other
hand, ``collective'' memory refers to shared memory, ``the shared
cultural past to which individuals contribute and upon which they call;
but ultimately a past that transcends individual
memory.''\autocites[360]{keith_ec2015}[See
also][180]{hubenthal_carstens-hasselbalch2012} The two ideas work
together and mutually influence one another. As Hübenthal puts it, ``The
difference {[}between social and collective memory{]} lies in the
perspective: \emph{social memory} is using the framework,
\emph{collective memory} is establishing
it.''\autocite[180.]{hubenthal_carstens-hasselbalch2012} Hübenthal's use
of the active verb ``establish'' is intentional: for Halbwachs,
collective memory is not a passive social accretion, but an actively
constructed part of the group's common identity which \emph{speaks to
the to concerns and needs of the community in the present}. Social
frameworks shape the way that people remember. The retrieval of memories
is shaped by those same frameworks, and as those frameworks shift, so
too do the memories that are recalled in those societies.\autocites[For
a modern assessments on the malleability of human memory and the effects
of social networks on the formation of collective memory,

\hypertarget{memory-and-history}{%
\section{Memory and History}\label{memory-and-history}}

In his later work, Halbwachs distinguished between two kinds of memory
which were distinguished by the experiential-relation of the individual
to the memory: autobiographical and historical
memory.\autocite[52]{halbwachs1980} Autobiographical memory refers to
the sort of memories which are the result of individual, subjective
experience, while historical memory refers to memories which fall
outside the experience of the individual. Elsewhere Halbwachs refers to
these as ``internal'' and ``external'' memory. Autobiographical memory
is rooted in the individual, sensory, experiences of the individual and
provides a full, ``thick'' memory (to borrow from Geertz) while
historical memory, necessarily, offers only a thin, schematic overview
and by definition is never ``experienced'' by the rememberer.

Although Halbwachs distinguished between these two forms of memory, he
nevertheless emphasized their interrelatedness. In particular, Halbwachs
notes that autobiographical memory necessarily is dependent upon
historical memory, insofar as our lives participate in ``general
history.''\autocite[52]{halbwachs1980} For example, memories of a more
indirect nature are able to shape autobiographical memory by shaping the
social frameworks which produced them and the frameworks into which they
are recalled. The quintessential example of this sort of indirect
influence for Americans of roughly my age would be the events of
September 11, 2001. Although comparatively few people directly witnessed
the events (I was asleep on the West Coast when the first plane
crashed), the impact that those events had (and continue to have) on the
orientation of American national memory is unquestionably a part of many
people's lived experience, including my own and would therefore
constitute a part of America's current ``collective memory.'' Although
the incoming undergraduate class at the University of Texas at Austin,
many of whom will have been born after 2001, have \emph{no}
autobiographical memory of these events, it is, nonetheless, a part of
the collective memory of which they are a part. On the other hand the
War of 1812 is not a part of any living person's autobiographical memory
and its impact on the collective memory of most Americans is likely
restricted to a few popular media references,{[}\^{}Such as Jimmy
Driftwood's \emph{The Battle of New Orleans}, best known as performed by
Johnny Horton which topped \emph{Billboard} charts in the US, Canada,
and Australia in 1959 and was recently acknowledged to be on of the Top
100 Western songs of all time. See,
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Battle\_of\_New\_Orleans.{]} or
localized to specific geographical regions with a close connection to
major events in the conflict (e.g., New Orleans).

The memories of historical events, however, are shaped by the social
frameworks of the rememberer. The events of September 11, 2001 in the
memory of most Americans are now shaped by the social discourses
surrounding the United States's continued military presence in the
region and its controversial pretexts for engagement in the region, in
particular with the Iraq war. Likewise, although no living person has an
autobiographical memory of the American Civil War, the construction of
certain confederate monuments on the campus of the University of Texas
at Austin during the Jim Crow era, and their subsequent removal in
August of 2017, illustrates how historical memory can be (consciously,
in this case) reshaped and restructured as the remembering society
changes.

It is the way that these remembered events change over time that makes
social memory studies so interesting for the historian. Halbwachs's own
work in the area of history is best seen in his work on \emph{The
Legendary Topography of the Holy Land}, where he focuses on the ways
that memories relate to particular geographic sites. In particular,
Halbwachs's study focuses on the way that the sites in and around the
Galilee and Jerusalem have been imbued with significance based on their
putative connection with some significant event relating to Jesus, the
Apostles, and early Christian communities. Halbwachs makes a number
observations about the way that memories are formed and the ways that
they interact which will become important for the current study.

Halbwachs's first observation comes in contrasting the portrayal of
Jesus within the Gospels with what must have been the lived experience
of the Apostles.\autocite[193--198]{halbwachs1992} The involvement of
the apostles in the day-to-day life of Jesus in some sense would have
prohibited them from achieving the kind of ``necessary detachment'' to
write something like the the Gospels. In other words (and to use
Halbwachs's later terminology), the memory of Jesus as protrayed in the
Gospels is almost necessarily informed by \emph{historical} rather than
autobiographical memory.\autocite[194]{halbwachs1992} Indeed, Halbwachs
rightly observes that the Gospels present Jesus and his ministry ``as if
Jesus's whole life was but a preparation for his death, as if this was
what he had announced in advance.''\autocite[198]{halbwachs1992} Surely
Jesus's mother remembered the death of her son differently than the way
the Church later commemorated it.\autocites[It is worth noting that
Halbachs himself compares his basic sentiment toward the historicity of
the Gospels as similar to that of Ernst Renan. Of course, the field of
New Testament studies has progressed considerably in content, method,
and nuance beyond Renan, whatever the merits of his work may have been.
While Halbachs seems to take seriously that Jesus did exist, he does not
accept the Gospels at face value as historically accurate. That said,
throughout the work, Halbwachs does talk about the ``actual'' past and
allows for the possibility that the Gospels do refer, at least
partially, to these real events. Which is to say, he is not making the
argument that the Gospels were fabricated of whole-cloth, but that the
``actual past'' is irretrievable and unknowable and that historical
memory has no obligation to align with the actual past as such.
Regardless of whether Halbwachs's conception of Early Christianity would
be considered sound today, the idea that the Gospels represent several
collective remembrances of Jesus's life, ministry and death each bearing
marks from their own \emph{Sitz im Leben} (to borrow from the form
critics) seems relatively uncontroversial. A number of studies on the
Jesus and early Christian memory have come about in the past several
years. See][]{ledonne2009}{rodriguez2010}[For an overview of the modern
impact of Halbwachs (and memory studies more generally) on the field of
Historical Jesus studies, see][]{keith_ec2015}[and][]{keith_ec2015b}

Halbwachs, drawing on the Pauline epistles, observes that the earliest
recollections of Jesus, however, make no mention of the location of his
death (Jerusalem) nor of his ministry (Galilee).

\begin{quote}
In the authentic epistles of Paul, we are told only that the son of God
has come to earth, that he died for our sins, and that he was brought
back to life again. There is no allusion to the circumstances of his
life, except for the Lord's Supper, which, Paul says, appeared to him in
a vision (and not through witnesses). There is no indication of
locality, no question of Galilee, or of the preachings of Jesus on the
shores of the lake of Gennesaret.\autocite[209]{halbwachs1992}
\end{quote}

Halbwachs's point is that within the narrative of the Gospels, the
location of Jesus's death---by virtue of the social and political
reality of the day---\emph{had} to occur in
Jerusalem.\autocite[211]{halbwachs1992} Whether or not it actually did,
or whether or not that information was explicitly handed down to the
authors of the Gospels is irrelevant for the purposes of collective
memory. Sacred places become sacred through the process of memory
\emph{construction}, not simply through the transmission of
autobiographical experience. According to Halbwachs, they are spaces
where significant ideas within the collective memory of a group can take
concrete form. He writes, ``Sacred places thus commemorate not facts
certified by contemporary witnesses but rather beliefs born perhaps not
far from these places and strengthened by taking root in this
environment.''\autocite[199]{halbwachs1992} Thus, localizing historical
memory functions as a way to move abstract ideas into the real world and
thus reinforce fundamental components of the group's collective memory.

Perhaps more interesting is Halbwachs's treatment of the ability for
memories to coalesce and split over time. Halbwachs makes the
observation that, according to tradition (i.e., the collective memory of
the Church), certain places in the Holy Land mark the location of
\emph{several} significant events. From an historical perspective
Halbwachs, obviously, doubts that assertions are accurate---even
assuming the events may have taken place one place or another---but,
finds the clustering of these events to be more than just coincidence.
For example, he writes:

\begin{quote}
One is surprised to find on the shores of the lake Gennesaret, near the
Seven Fountains, the place where apostles were chosen, the Sermon on the
Mount, the appearance of Jesus on the waters after the
Resurrection---all in the same place.\autocite[220]{halbwachs1992}
\end{quote}

Halbwachs's assumption is that there was something about the location
\emph{itself}, some ``earlier
consecration,''\autocite[220]{halbwachs1992} which attracted these
memories to particular locales. Extending this rationale further, we can
appreciate the fact that for Christianity, the significance of Jerusalem
is not limited to the significance of the city as the location of
Jesus's death, but rather by the prior significance of the city for
Judaism. Within the collective memory of Christian tradition, one might
say that Jerusalem is not significant because it is the location of the
Passion and resurrection of Jesus, but that the Passion and resurrection
of Jesus happened in Jerusalem because Jerusalem was significant.
Halbwachs writes:

\begin{quote}
The Christian collective memory could annex a part of Jewish collective
memory only by appropriating part of the latter's local remembrance
while at the same time transforming its entire perspective of historical
space.\autocite[215]{halbwachs1992}
\end{quote}

One might object to this suggestion by noting that, supposing Jesus
\emph{actually was} crucified in Jerusalem, one hardly needs to
re-appropriate Jewish tradition or attribute this remembrance to some
special process. Yet, it is worth pointing out in cases where the
historical data are lacking (or, perhaps, where eyewitness accounts did
not exist), this same basic phenomenon occurred. For example, Halbwachs
points to the birth narratives of the Gospels, in particular that of
Matthew, where Jesus is described as being born in Bethlehem, the ``city
of David.'' Although there is no reason to think that Jesus was
\emph{actually} born in Bethlehem, Halbwachs, rightly observes, ``the
authors of the gospels seem entirely to have invented this poetic
history which has occupied a considerable place in Christian
History.''\autocite[214]{halbwachs1992} In fact, Jesus's entire
portrayal in the Gospel of Matthew is an exercise in collective
remembrance which is structured on the foundational narratives of the
Hebrew Bible (e.g., the slaughter of innocents, and Jesus's portrayal as
a lawgiver ``on the mount''), and framed as the fulfillment of Jewish
prophecy.

The inverse of this phenomenon is also observable. According to
Halbwachs while some events converge to particular locations, other
events diverge among several sites. One expression of this process is by
dividing the \emph{event} and localizing each part of the event to a
particular place or object. For example, Halbwachs notes how the memory
of specific important events, such as the Passion, may be split and
localized at a very fine level of detail:

\begin{quote}
Around Golgotha and the Holy Sepulchre, for example, we find the rock of
anointing, the rock of the angel, the rock of the gardener, the place
where Jesus was stripped, etc.\autocite[220]{halbwachs1992}
\end{quote}

The proliferation of these micro-sites of memory, according to
Halbwachs, aide and reinforce the collective memory through repetition.
Furthermore, the added detail serves in ``renewing and rejuvenating an
ancient image.''\autocite[220]{halbwachs1992}

The same event may also be localized in multiple places. Halbwachs
describes several traditional locations of the Cenacle (the ``Upper
Room'' from the Gospels), including the Mount of Olives, Gethsemane, and
the Grotto of Jesus's teaching. These traditions coexisted into the
fourth century, yet, later, the site was moved to the Christian hill of
Zion. Likewise, Halbachs notes there were two locations for Emmaus and
two different mountains on which Jesus appeared in Galilee after his
resurrection. While it runs counter to our modern historiographical
sensibilities, the ability of seemingly contradictory traditions to
coexist is well documented.

Halbwachs points out that autobiographical memory does not allow for
this kind of fragmentation. We all realize that the same event from our
own past can not have happened in two locations simultaneously. Yet,
Halbwachs points out that should that same person belong to two groups
who disagree on a particular remembered event (one that the individual
did not personally witness), the individual is able to hold the
disagreement without the need assert one or the other. the same is true
of complex social entities, such as religious groups, who are composed
of several subgroups with their own collective memories. Halbwachs
writes:

\begin{quote}
A community must often accommodate itself to contradictions introduced
by diverse groups so long as none of these groups prevails, or so long
as the community itself does not find a new reason for decisively
settling the issue. This is especially true when the community faces a
controversy about its rites, which are an anchor for its component
groups.\autocite[224]{halbwachs1992}
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{the-memory-boom}{%
\section{The Memory Boom}\label{the-memory-boom}}

Halbwachs's work, while not ignored, did not make its most significant
contributions until well after his death. It is frequently argued that
the so-called `memory boom,' which began in the 1980's in the wake of
the `theory boom,' picked up Halbwachs's terminology and central ideas
in an attempt to deal with perceived insufficiency of traditional
historiography to deal with the sorts of major, traumatic events which
characterized the mid 20th
Century.\autocites[1--2]{galinsky_galinsky2016}[See also][29--36. One
cannot help but speculate that---at least in the English-speaking
world---the translation of \emph{The Collective Memory} in 1980
contributed to the popularity of Halbwachs's
terminology.]{olick_olick-etal2011} Works such as Yosef
\textasciitilde{}yerushalmi's \emph{Zakhor: Jewish History and Jewish
Memory} and Pierre Nora's \emph{Les Lieux de mémoire} are typically
cited as the foundational works of the modern memory
boom.\autocites[112--113]{klein2011}{yerushalmi1989}[Nora's massive
project has been abridged and translated into English as][]{nora1996}

In \emph{Zakhor}, \textasciitilde{}yerushalmi is quick to identify the
tension between what traditional cultures and societies remember about
their past and how the modern discipline of history treats the past. For
remembering groups, what is preserved in the collective memory is what
is useful for the edification of that group---whether through religious
ritual, family stories, or some other combination of received
traditions. Of course, prior to the enlightenment, this was the default
mode of understanding the past for most people, and remains so for many
social groups, including those within modern, Western societies. In
particular, \textasciitilde{}yerushalmi addresses this tension for the
Jewish historian---a vocation which, he notes, is a recent phenomenon.
Although, ancient Israel and Judah, clearly, were concerned with
historical matters---much of the Hebrew Bible is preoccupied with
narrating events from the perceived past---these codified traditions are
preserved in a plurality of socio-religious groups for a complex set of
purposes spanning cultural, social, and theological modes of discourse
which are fundamentally at odds with the modern discipline of history.
Thus, the biblical command to ``remember,'' is not a command to keep
tedious notes of historically accurate events, but a cultural and
theological imperative to maintain the foundational narratives of the
community. \textasciitilde{}yerushalmi writes:

\begin{quote}
There the fact that history has meaning does not mean that everything
that happened in history is meaningful or worthy of recollection. Of
Manasseh of Judah, a powerful king, who reigned for fifty-five years in
Jerusalem, we hear only that ``he did what was evil in the sight of the
Lord'' (II Kings 21:2).\autocite[10]{yerushalmi1989}
\end{quote}

In other words, what was remembered about Manasseh by the biblical
tradants were those details which were useful for their socio-religious
projects. The rules and methods of this process---remembering what is
important and forgetting what is not---are generally not explicit or
transparent.

\textbf{Paragraph on Nora}

The modern discipline of history, on the other hand, generally attempts
to uphold a certain set of explicit methodological and theoretical
criteria which---while not exempt from distortion by the subjectivity of
the historian---can be corroborated or contradicted by evidence and
argumentation.\autocite[As Daniel Pioske puts it, ``What separates the
act of historiography from the recounting of a culture's sanctioned
memories is consequently the historians' determination to isolate and
compare disparate testimonies about the past with other past traces that
ma corroborate or discredit their
claims.''][302--303]{pioske_bibint2015} While the historian participates
in the collective memory of her own society, her reconstruction of the
past attempts to approach the topic from the outside. The historian,
too, (re)constructs the past, but the goals of the historian are, as
\textasciitilde{}yerushalmi puts it, to recreate ``an ever more detailed
past whose shapes and textures memory does not
recognize.''\autocites[94]{yerushalmi1989}[See
also][532]{verovsek_pgi2016} Even the most theory-conscious historian
cannot help but struggle in avoidng older discourses about ``what really
happened'' particularly when stated over and against memory in the form
of received tradition. All of this is not to say that modern history
writing is in any meaningful sense ``objective,'' nor that the historian
is able to remove herself from her own socio-political context. So,
although memory and history both offer reconstructions of the past, it
is important to affirm that their modes of doing so are radically
different.\autocite[Pioske observes, ``The epistemological tension
observed by Ricoeur between memory and history is thus understood as the
outcome of two processes that, though having the similar intent of
re-presenting former phenomena, nevertheless pursue and mediate the past
through quite disparate means.''][302]{pioske_bibint2015}

Thus the memory ``boom'' has, in some circles, been viewed as
anti-historical and an attempt at ``resacrilization of the past''
brought about by the disenchantment of the past by modern historical
consciousness\autocite[282]{winter2006} Kerwin Klein, for example,
traces the origins of scholarly discourse surrounding memory and lists
five narratives that others have offered as explanations for the origins
of memory discourse in society generally:

\begin{quote}
We have, then, several alternative narratives of the origins of our new
memory discourse. The first, following Pierre Nora, holds that we are
obsessed with memory because we have destroyed it with historical
consiousness. A second holds that memory is a new category of experience
that grew out of the modernist crisis of the self in the nineteenth
century and the gradually eveloved into our current usage. A third
sketches a tale in which Hegelian historicism took up premodern forms of
memory that we have since modified through structural vocabularies. A
fourth implies that memory is a mode of discourse natural to people
without history, and so its emergence is a salutary feature of
decolonization. And a fifth claims that memory talk is a belated
response to the wounds of modernity.\autocite[134]{klein_klein2011}
\end{quote}

Although Klein finds none of these ``fully satisfying,'' it is
noteworthy that the general trend among these narratives corroborates
the thesis that memory represents a ``reaction'' against history in some
form.

Whatever combination of these causes may have ultimately brought about
the memory boom, the problem remains, according to Klein, that
``memory'' has come to dominate historical discourse as a ``therapeutic
alternative'' to history in place of a rigorous scientific
methodology.\autocite[137]{klein2011} As Winter puts it, ``It is a fix
for those who cannot stand the harshness of critical thinking or
historical analysis.''\autocite[283]{winter2006} Although I think Klein
under-appreciates the value of the memory discourse as a meaningful mode
of inquiry, I am in fact, quite sympathetic to his critique overall. As
methodologies for querying the past, memory and history operate on
different sets of hermeneutical and epistemological foundations, which
is, I think, one of \textasciitilde{}yerushalmi's main points. However,
what Klein does not address is the way that, for modern Westerners,
history \emph{is} our collective memory (or at least, heavily influences
our collective memory). This is what Nora means when he says that ``We
speak so much of memory because there is so little of it
left.''\autocite[7]{nora_representations1989} And for Klein, this is a
good thing---historical consciousness is uniquely valuable as a
scientific endeavor and jettisoning this critical posture toward the
past is tantamount to abandoning the enlightenment.

For modern historians studying the collective memory of other modern
people, it is easy to conflate the historical consciousness of the
historian subject and that of the object. Such historical work relies on
court documents, news articles, eyewitness accounts, and other
documentary evidence that operates within an historical consciousness
that closely resembles that of the historian. As a result, the historian
can utilize her own historical intuitions when interacting with her
sources. In Halbwachsian terms, the social frameworks (in this case the
understanding of the way ``history'' is done) of the historian and their
object of study are quite similar. For example, reading news reports
from the mid-twentieth century does not require the historian to
dramatically reorient her understanding of what ``news'' is. On the
other hand, when studying ancient history, the intellectual distance
between the source and the historian is, often, much more pronounced.
Reading ``historical'' texts which present themselves in fairly neutral
terms often requires a degree of hermeneutical suspicion that similar
documents from the modern age do not.

In fact, biblical scholars in particular have been dealing with this
problem since the enlightenment. The tension between memory and history
is played out clearly in both Jewish and Christian circles vis-à-vis
historical-critical study of the Bible. Insofar as the Bible forms a
major portion of both Jewish and Christian collective memory,
historical-critical approaches to the biblical text continue to be met
with fervent opposition in more conservative traditions. Parallels to
what Klein describes within the discipline of History can be seen within
biblical studies as well. Consider, for example, the way that Brevard
Childs's canonical approach attempted to ``overcome the long-established
tension between the canon and criticism.''\autocite[45]{childs1979} For
Childs, writing an introduction to the Old Testament in the traditional
manner (i.e., as an historical-critical introduction) was insufficient
for use in churches or synagogues because it bypassed a fundamental
aspect of the biblical text, the canon. Although he does not use the
language of memory in his discussion of canon (though, it should be
noted he made an important early contribution to the idea of memory in
the biblical tradition which, I imagine, is not a
coincidence\autocite{childs1962}), here we can see that the various
canons of scripture in use by Christians and Jews throughout the world
nevertheless function as a form of collective memory by constructing and
filtering what should and should not be remembered by the community.

The tension between history and memory (or in the case of Childs,
``canon and criticism'') is most problematic---as evidenced by
Childs---when the historian participates within the collective memory of
the community under investigation. This is why both Childs and
\textasciitilde{}yerushalmi express their discomfort and dissatisfaction
while attempting to operate with one foot in each world and this is, I
think, the central critique of Klein: historians operate from the
outside looking in (an etic approach), while practitioners of memory
operate from within (an emic approach). Yet, this etic/emic distinction
only makes sense when memory is placed on equal footing with history as
a means of interrogating the past. From this perspective, I
wholeheartedly agree with Klein that such an approach undercuts the
epistemological foundations of modern historical inquiry. However, Klein
does not address memory as the \emph{object} of historical study. This,
I think, is what makes \textasciitilde{}yerushalmi's approach so
intriguing. Although he acknowledges his precarious position as a Jewish
historian, \textasciitilde{}yerushalmi discusses memory \emph{as an
historian} and it is this approach which I think is the most fruitful
avenue of memory research. Thus, this dissertation will treat memory as
a phenomenon which can be studied historically rather than as a source
of information about the past.

\section{Memory, Myth, and the ``Actual
Past''}\label{memory-myth-and-the-actual-past}}

Halbwachs's did not see any reason to assume that the remembered past
had any meaningful connection to the ``actual past.'' Because memory is
always constructed in the present for use in the present, the ``actual
past'' does not carry any meaningful influence on this (re)construction.
It was in his \textasciitilde{}legendary-topography that Halbwachs's
makes this case most forcefully, and I think he does so quite
convincingly. Halbwachs's understanding of memory as a phenomenon of the
present has thus earned him the label ``presentist'' or
``constructivist'' over and against a number of more recent theorists
who wish to attribute to the past some normative
force.\autocite[27--30]{coser_halbwachs1992} This presentist mantle has
been donned by a number of more recent scholars, perhaps most notably by
the German scholars Jan and Aleida Assmann.\autocites[See
esp.][]{assmann_nikulin2015}{assmann2011}[and][]{a_assmann2011}

\hypertarget{the-presentist-perspective}{%
\subsection{The Presentist
Perspective}\label{the-presentist-perspective}}

Where Halbwachs distinguished between autobiographical and historical
memory, Jan Assmann describes what he calls communicative and cultural
memory (German: \emph{kommunikatives} and \emph{kulturelles}
\emph{Gedächtnis}, respectively).\autocites[36]{assmann2011}[For a
concise terminological crash-course,
see][182--183]{hubenthal_carstens-hasselbalch2012} Rather than focus on
the relationship of the rememberer to the experience (viz. whether the
memory is ``autobiographical''), this terminology essentially
distinguishes between synchronic and diachronic processes of memory. On
the one hand, communicative memory represents a synchronic, or
``horizontal'' memory shared by a society at a particular chronological
horizon, based on direct communication between individuals. According to
Assmann, this memory has a temporal horizon of 80--100 years---limited
by spatial (where people are) and chronological (how long people live)
factors. He writes:

\begin{quote}
A typical instance would be generational memory that accrues within the
group, originating and disappearing with time or, to be more precise,
with its carriers. Once those who embodied it have died, it gives way to
a new memory.\autocite[36]{assmann2011}
\end{quote}

On the other hand, at the end of this period, as the memory begins to
lose relevance and those with direct connections to the events, people,
and places which the memories involve die off, the remembering community
will either forget or transform the memory for long-term transmission in
the form of \emph{cultural memory}. The canonization of memory at points
during this period is a conscious, \emph{constructive} activity by a
remembering group. \autocite[45]{assmann2011}

Where Halbwachs's terminology took as its point of departure the
psychological perspective toward memory of
Freud\autocite{terdiman_radstone-schwarz2011} and
Bergson\autocite{ansellpearson_radstone-schwarz2011}, Assmann's taxonomy
is rooted in ethnological research on oral traditions, specifically that
of Jan Vansina and his notion of a ``floating gap'' between the present
and the distant past.\autocite{vansina1985} Vansina observes that in
oral cultures often there is an abundance of common knowledge about
current goings-on and a similar abundance of shared knowledge about the
distant past (esp.~with regard to origin stories and the like), but
there often exists a gap for the not-so-distant past. The proportion of
collective knowledge, therefore, is unevenly distributed between two
chronological poles of memory, although members of the society in
question may not perceive it as such in their own reconstructions of the
past.{[}\textcite{vansina1985}, 23--24; As Assmann, observes, ``In the
cultural memory of a group, both levels of the past merge seamlessly
into one another.''{]} In other words, from the perspective of the
remembering society, often there exists a continuity between the distant
past (often legendary or mythic) and the near-past (a few generations,
at most) where in reality a good deal of the not-so-recent past has
fallen from memory. Memory of the near-past---those things which, while
not necessarily ``autobiographical'' to every rememberer, nevertheless
are reinforced by those with autobiographical memory---is categorized as
``communicative'' because it is memory that it generated and spread in
the present by those with direct access to the events in question. Those
memories which are deemed significant enough to not be forgotten---those
which make up cultural memory---undergo a process by which they are
transformed from ``factual into remembered history,'' and may take the
form of myth or legend.\autocite[37--38]{assmann2011} Thus, according to
Assmann, myth and legend cannot be distinguished from ``history'' as a
part of cultural memory. The significance of an event is not tied to
whether or not it is ``factual,'' but by its ``truth'' seen through its
continued relevance to the remembering community in the present. Assmann
writes:

\begin{quote}
Myth is foundational history that is narrated in order to illuminate the
present from the standpoint of its origins. The Exodus, for instance,
regardless ofany historical accuracy, is the myth behind the foundation
of Israel; thus it is celebrated at Pesach and thus it is part of the
cultural memory of the Israelites. Through memory, history becomes myth.
This does not make it unreal---on the contrary, this is what makes it
real, in the sense that it becomes a lasting, normative, and formative
power.\autocite[38]{assmann2011}
\end{quote}

Assmann's understanding of the relationship of the actual past to a
society's cultural memory, therefore is not concerned with the
discussion of the historicity of cultural memory. Although Assmann does
not dismiss cultural memory as a source for historical inquiry, like
Halbwachs, his primary interest is in exploring the constructive,
presentist aspects of memory.

\subsection{The Continuity
Perspective}\label{the-continuity-perspective}}

Among the critics of Halbwachs's presentist posture (and, by extension,
that of Jan and Aleida Assmann) , Barry Schwartz in particular has
attempted to offer a more nuanced approach to addressing what he argues
is the continued impact of the past on collective
memory.\autocites[Schwartz has made numerous contributions to the field
of memory studies. See
esp.][]{schwartz_sf1982}{schwartz_asr1991}[and][]{schwartz2000}[Note
also the SBL volume specifically interacting with his
work:][]{thatcher2014}

\hypertarget{collective-memory-and-cultural-memory-and-social-memory-a-terminological-assessment}{%
\section{Collective Memory, and Cultural Memory, and Social Memory: A
Terminological
Assessment}\label{collective-memory-and-cultural-memory-and-social-memory-a-terminological-assessment}}

Although Halbwachs used the term ``collective memory'' to talk about the
interaction between memory at the individual, psychological level and
the social frameworks which enable the act of recollection, recent work
in memory studies has seen a proliferation of terminology which has both
clarified and (at times) obfuscated the discussion

In fact, there is a grand tradition of imprecise and overlapping
terminologies within memory studies going back to Halbwachs himself. For
example, on page 40 of \emph{On Collective Memory}, Halbwachs uses the
terms ``collective memory,'' ``social memory,'' ``social frameworks of
memory,'' and ``collective frameworks of memory'' and it is not entirely
clear what how Halbwachs is distinguishing between them. The way that he
is able to use the terms almost interchangeably has led some in the
current discussion to treat them as synonyms. As Anthony Le Donne
observes, ``In fact, {[}``social'' and ``collective'' memory{]} are
currently used synonymously with such frequency that their nuances vary
from author to author \autocite[42 n.8]{ledonne2009}. Yet, Le Donne
points out, Halbwachs actually uses these terms in with slightly
different nuances. On the one hand, Halbwachs uses the term''sociaux"
when he is describing the way social structures affect memory, while on
the other hand ``Collective Memory'' tends to refer to the content of
memories which are transmitted between individuals \autocite[42
n.8]{ledonne2009}. In other words, when Halbawachs uses the term
``social'' he is usually talking about \emph{frameworks} of memory,
whereas ``collective memory'' might be cautiously glossed as ``common''
or ``shared'' memory. Sandra Hübenthal puts it well, ``The difference
{[}between social and collective memory{]} lies in the perspective:
\emph{social memory} is using the framework, \emph{collective memory} is
establishing it'' \autocite[180]{hubenthal_carstens-hasselbalch2012}.
