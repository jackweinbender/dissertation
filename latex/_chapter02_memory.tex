Rewritten Bible}\label{social-memory-studies-and-the-rwb}}

The past several decades, beginning in the late 1970's, a dramatic
increase in scholarly interest toward the topic of ``memory'' has swept
throughout the social sciences. The precipitous rise in scholarly
literature dealing with topics of memory coupled with its proliferation
in popular media discourses has prompted some in the field to refer to
the ``memory industry'' and to describe the ubiquity of memory
discourses as a ``boom'' fast-approaching a
bust.\autocites{rosenfeld_jmh2009}{winter2006}{berliner_aq2005} Yet, as
Olick et al.~make very clear in their Introduction to \emph{The
Collective Memory Reader}, there remain a significant number of scholars
throughout the social sciences who continue to find ``memory'' to a
useful heuristic and a compelling theoretical basis for their various
and sundry analytical applications.\autocite[3--6]{olick_olick-etal2011}

Although the topic of ``memory'' has been of interest philosophers and
thinkers since the ancient Greeks, as Olick and Robbins note, the modern
social-scientific approaches which concern this chapter almost
exclusively trace their genealogy to the early 20th century work of
sociologist Maurice Halbwachs.\autocites[106]{olick-robbins_ars1998}[It
should be noted, however, that Halbwachs was not the first or only
person to do work on memory or the impact of society thereon, despite
most recent literature's preoccupation with him,
see][8--36]{olick_olick-etal2011} Although Halbwachs's work was not
limited to exploring the topic of social memory (he also made
contributions to statictics and probability theory, as well as
sociological work on the topic of suicide and social
morphology\autocite[13--20]{coser_halbwachs1992}), his work in this area
has managed to endure and continues to find new applications and to
inspire new approaches in ways that his other contributions have
not.\footnote{Halbwachs's seminal work on the topic of memory, published
  in 1925 under the title \emph{The Social Frameworks of Memory}
  (\emph{Les cadres sociaxu de la mémoire}) was excerpted and translated
  into English in 1992 by Lewis Coser along with the final chapter of
  his short book on the remembrance of the Holy Land, entitled \emph{The
  Legendary Topography of the Holy Land} (\emph{la topographie
  légendaire des évangiles en terre sinte: Etude de mémoire collective})
  in a single volume under the title \emph{On Collective
  Memory}.\autocite{halbwachs1992} These two works, in some sense, form
  the core of Halbwachs's work. A third volume, however, entitled
  \emph{The Collective Memory} (\emph{La mémoire collective}) was
  published posthumously in 1950 and translated into English in 1980
  with an editorial introduction by Mary
  Douglas.\autocite{halbwachs1980} This work simultaneously represents
  some of Halbwachs's most developed ideas (while responding to critics)
  and evinces an incompleteness which posthumous publications often
  suffer. As Coser observes, ``One may doubt that the author himself
  would have been willing to publish it in what seems to be an
  unfinished state. The book nevertheless contains many further
  developments of Halbwachs's thought in regard to such matters as the
  relation of space and time to collective memory as well as fruitful
  definitions and applications of the differences between individual,
  collective, and historical memory.''\autocite{coser_halbwachs1992}}

The central contribution of Halbwachs's work was the notion that human
memory is intrinsically and inextricably tied to its social context.
This focus on the \emph{social} dimensions of memory betrays the deep
influence that Émile Durkheim's work had on Halbwachs. Humans are social
beings and as such human processes, such as memory, can only be
completed within the context of a society. Unlike Durkheim, however,
Halbwachs's approach was tempered by his desire to identify the physical
(or, perhaps ``biological'') location of memory within the individual.
Although the term ``collective memory'' evokes an ethereal or
metaphysical idea, Halbwachs's use of the term is entirely concrete.
Individual memories are kept by \emph{individuals}. However, an
individuals' ability to retrieve and utilize a particular memory is
intrinsically tied to the individual's social context. Memories require
social frameworks to function.{[}halbwachs1992, 38{]}

To illustrate this point, Halbwachs begins \emph{The Social Frameworks
of Memory} by attempting to prove the negative. \emph{Without} a social
framework, he argues, memories are always incomplete. It is in the dream
state, he avers, that most closely approximates the complete isolation
of the human mind from society and therefor the way that the human brain
deals with memories while dreaming can likewise illustrate the
(dis)function of memories lacking a social framework. He writes:

\begin{quote}
It is at this moment {[}in the dream state{]} that he is no longer
capable---nor has need---of relying on frames of collective memory. It
is then possible to measure the operation of these frameworks by
observing what becomes of individual memory when this operation is no
longer present.\autocite[39]{halbwachs1992}
\end{quote}

Contra Freud \emph{et, al.}, Halbwachs argues that it is not in
\emph{memory} that the human mind is most isolated, but rather in the
dream state. Memory, on the other hand \emph{cannot} be understood in
isolation from its social framework. This is why, according to
Halbwachs, ``{[}no{]} real and complete memory ever appears in our
dreams as it appears in our waking state,''\autocite[41]{halbwachs1992}
Halbwach is able to argue that it is the social frameworks of memory
which anchor human memory.
