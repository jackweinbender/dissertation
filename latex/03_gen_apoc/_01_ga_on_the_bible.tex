\section{`Say You Are My Sister': Genesis Apocrypohon and the Biblical Tradition}

% Abram and Sarai in Egypt
%% Rewriting of the biblical account
%% What are the points of contact with the Bible and other contemporary sources? (Jubilees, Enoch, etc.)
%% What is GA's relationship *to* the Bible
    %% Conflating Pharoah and Abimelek is "interpretation" collapsing to a single story
    %% Cedar and Date Palm? Dafuck is going on here?

% (re)frame this example as 'memory.'
    %% A synthesis of traditions about Abe and Sarai
    %% Likely some innovative stuff
    %% But it's not beholden to the tradition. That is, it is participating in the creation of tradition and that tradition may be able to be traced as continuiing into the Gen. Rab. with the Cedar and DatePalm stuff (?)
