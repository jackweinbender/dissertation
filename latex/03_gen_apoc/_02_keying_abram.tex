\section{Abram in the Diaspora: The Literary Frameworks of \GA}

Having dealt with the \ga as the product of cultural memory in terms of its relationship to its inherited biblical memory (including the traditions which were ancillary to Genesis proper), we may now turn our attention to the ways that the \ga addressed its audience at the level of \emph{social} memory. In this section I will address the way that the \ga \emph{speaks to} its audience and the ways that the \ga changes and adapts its cultural memory into a meaningful piece of literature for \secondtemple Judaism.

As I have already noted, the narrative of the \ga is not simply a straight-forward retelling of Genesis from the perspectives of Lamech, Noah, and Abram, but participates more broadly in the ``biblical memory'' of Genesis. However, what is most compelling about \rwb texts very often is the ways that they adapt biblical memory. These adaptations can come at the level of story---by adding, removing, or rearranging events---or at the level of narrative discourse by describing events differently or with different emphases. In the case of \ga, and in particular in the account of Abram in cols. 19--22, the biblical narrative has been recast as a (first-person) Hellenistic novella in a similar vein to other well-known Second Temple Jewish works such as the narrative portions of Daniel (including the Greek additions), Esther, Tobit, and (arguably) the so-called Joseph novella of Genesis 37 and 39--50.\footnote{See especially Lawrence Wills work on the Jewish novels and novellas in antiquity: \cite*{wills2002} as well as his important earlier works \cite*{wills1995} and \cite{wills1990}.}

The reading of \ga 19--20 as a Hellenistic Jewish novella has recently been very thoroughly explicated by Blake Jurgens, who has further argued that the utilization of Hellenistic literary motifs and structures in \ga altered the overall purpose the the pericope for the purpose of edifying Jews living in the Hellenistic world in the shadow of empire.\autocite{jurgens_jsj2018} Although much of Jurgen's paper is based on long-established observations about the literary influences on \ga, he makes the important discursive turn toward the audience by claiming that the \ga was meant to be useful to readers:

\begin{quote}
By imbuing its story with literary tropes and techniques similar to those found in Dan 1--6, Esther, and other Jewish texts arising out of the Hellenistic period, the author successfully attends to the narratival ambiguities of Gen 12:10--20 through interpretive expansion upon the latent exegetical links of the text while concurrently modifying the narrative to appeal to contemporary literary expectations.\autocite[27]{jurgens_jsj2018} \end{quote}

The process of this transcription, which he terms ``fictionalization,'' is described by Jurgens in six distinct narrative units within cols. 19--20 of \ga which describe Abram and Sarai's sojourn in Egypt: the decent into Egypt, Abram's dream vision, the banquet scene, praise of Sarai's beauty, Abram's prayer, and the final court contest. In each section Jurgens notes the ways that the \ga utilizes literary structures common to its broader Hellenistic mileu to rewrite the the events of this story. Jurgens offers a very thorough description of the ways that the \ga utilizes these literary structures and makes a plausible claim that these changes were meant to engage readers in familiar style. 

Thinking in terms of social memory, however, we can appreciate the way that the story of Abram and Sarai in Egypt is ``remembered into'' the social context of Hellenistic Judaism and is fitted into the contemporary social frameworks (read: literary conventions) therein. In other words, the changes which Jurgens identifies as intended to engage with readers can also be framed as changes which social conventions---by which we mean literary conventions---have affected the way that the author/editor of \ga presents the story, its plot, and characters.

\subsection{Setting}

One of the primary features of Jewish hellenistic novellas is their setting. Jurgens notes that, typically, these Jewish novellas are set in the diaspora, which invariably place the Jewish (or, in Tobit and Judith's case, Israelite) protagonist under the hegemony of a foreign power. In the case of \ga, although not properly ``diaspora,'' Abram is a sojourner in a foreign land and is under foreign hegemony. Moreover, from a modern perspective, these stories have a tendency to commit rather egregious factual errors about certain historical particulars such as the names of rulers (Judith 1:1; Dan 4; Tobit) and geographic items (Tobit 5:6). Likewise, \ga seems to utilize details which almost certainly were inventions of the author (or an earlier tradant) such as referring to ``Pharaoh Zoan'' (we know of no such figure) and Herqanos, a name popular in the Ptolemaic period, but not attested otherwise as well as referring to the ``Karmon River'' (probably the Kharma canal), as the one of the seven heads of the Nile river, which it is not.\autocites[7]{jurgens_jsj2018}[See also][50--59]{machiela_as2010}[197--199]{fitzmyer2004} These details, according to Jurgens, are meant to create a sense of verisimilitude and authenticity within the narrative. Thus, although the story of Abram's sojourn in Egypt as narrated in the biblical text engages with discourses of the \emph{foundation} of Israel, the narrative of the \ga seems to be turning the story to engage with the contemporary discourses around the idea of \emph{diaspora}. In other words the way that Abram's sojourn in Egypt was remembered in the \secondtemple period, at least in part, took on new meaning for those sojourning in the diaspora and for those living in the land under foreign hegemony.

\subsection{Abram in the Court of a Foreign King: Literary Genre as Social Framework}

Thinking about this part of the \ga under the rubric of diaspora literature, the account bears a striking resemblance to other so-called court contest narratives, well-known from (especially) the book of Daniel.\footnote{\cite[TODO: pages]{collins1993}; \cite{collins_jbl1975}; \cite{wills1990}.}
