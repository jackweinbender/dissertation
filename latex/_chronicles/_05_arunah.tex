As a final example of the mnemonic processes at work in the book of \chronicles, I will discuss the account of David's Census and the Threshing Floor of Araunah/Ornan found in 1 Chr 21:1--22:1 as a product of cultural memory. When compared to the parallel account in 2 Sam 24:1--24, the story as told in \chronicles is not simply a modified or ``cleaned up'' version of the story, but offers a narrative which functions in a distinct fashion compared to that of 2 Sam 24. This recontextualized narrative not only operates on different sets of ideological and theological presuppositions, but re-situates the narrative within the social memory by making magnetic connections to the major themes and ideas of the \chronicler's society.

The story of David's census in 2 Sam 24:1--24 begins with \yahweh inciting David to take a census of his army because \yahweh was angry with him. He dispatches his general, Joab, to take the census. Joab is successful and, after nine months, reports back to David the results of the census. Upon hearing the results, ``David's heart was stricken because he had numbered the people'' (Heb. \hebrew{וַיַּךְ לֵב־דָּוִד אֹתוֹ אַחֲרֵי־כֵן סָפַר אֶת־הָעָם}). David asks for forgiveness from \yahweh, who gives him three options for punishment. After the punishment of pestilence is executed against several thousand Israelites, \yahweh relents before striking Jerusalem and instructs his angel (Heb. \hebrew{מַלְאַךְ})---who at that moment was at the threshing floor of a man named Araunah (a Jebusite)---to cease destroying the people. Later, the prophet Gad instructs David to build an altar to \yahweh at the site of Araunah's threshing floor. David purchases the threshing floor, offers sacrifices to \yahweh, and ``the plague was averted from upon Israel'' (\hebrew{וַתֵּעָצַר הַמַּגֵּפָה מֵעַל יִשְׂרָאֵל}).

With the exception of a few key details and additions, the version presented in 1 Chr 21:1--22:1 follows the version in 2 Samuel very closely.%
    \footnote{In smaller textual matters one must be careful to remember that the \vorlage of the \chronicler was not identical to the Masoretic text. Indeed the textual plurality of the \lxx, \q{4}{Sam}{a}, and references in Josephus's \ant caution against assuming every difference between the \chronicler's account and that of 2 Samuel (MT) are the result of some change made by the \chronicler. See \cite[761--762]{knoppers2007}.}
The description of the census itself is mostly the same as the MT of 1 Samuel, though differences (such as the specific numbers reported) do occur. The most significant change to the first part of the story, however, is the attribution of David's incitement to take the census to an entity referred to as ``(a) Satan'' (Heb. \hebrew{שָׂטָן}):

\begin{hebrewtext}
    \versenum{1 Chr 21:1}
    וַיַּעֲמֹד שָׂטָן עַל־יִשְׂרָאֵל וַיָּסֶת אֶת־דָּוִיד לִמְנוֹת אֶת־יִשְׂרָאֵל׃
\end{hebrewtext}
\begin{translation}
    \versenum{1 Chr 21:1}
    (A) Satan arose against Israel and incited David to number Israel.
\end{translation}
\noindent
Scholars remain divided over whether \hebrew{שָׂטָן} should be understood as a simple indefinite noun ``an adversary,''%
    \footnote{%
        \cite{stokes_jbl2009};
        \cite[114--117]{japhet2009};
        \cite[370--390]{japhet1993}.}
or whether the absence of the definite article indicates that by the time of the Chronicler, Satan referred to a malevolent spirit which prefigured the more developed, personified ``Satan'' found in the New Testament.%
    \autocite[4--5]{rollston_keith-stuckenbruck2016}
The most common usage of the term \hebrew{שָׂטָן} in the Hebrew Bible refers to human adversaries and accusers (Num 22:22, 32; 1~Sam 29:4, 2~Sam 19:23; 1~Kgs 5:18, 11:14, 23, 25; Ps 38:21, 71:13, 109:4, 6, 20, 29). However, the figure \hebrew{הַשָּׂטָן} (with definite article) in both the prologue to Job (Job 1--2) and Zech 3:1--2 appears as a celestial figure to whom Yahweh speaks directly.
    \footnote{This notion is more clear in Job, where \hebrew{הַשָּׂטָן} is described in the heavenly courts and is described as having supernatural powers over the health and prosperity of those on the Earth. On the other hand, the reference in Zechariah is somewhat ambiguous. Zech 3:1 reads: \hebrew{ וַיַּרְאֵנִי אֶת־יְהוֹשֻׁעַ הַכֹּהֵן הַגָּדוֹל עֹמֵד לִפְנֵי מַלְאַךְ יְהוָה וְהַשָּׂטָן עֹמֵד עַל־יְמִינוֹ לְשִׂטְנוֹ}, ``And he showed me Joshua, the high priest standing before the angel of Yahweh, and \translit{haśśāṭān} was standing on his right (side) to accuse him.'' The antecedent of ``his'' in ``his right(side)'' is unclear. If ``his'' refers to the \hebrew{מַלְאַךְ} Yahweh, then \hebrew{הַשָּׂטָן} likely refers to some kind of spiritual being. However, it is possible that ``his'' refers to Joshua, and that \hebrew{הַשָּׂטָן} should be understood as a human adversary.}
Proponents of reading \hebrew{שָׂטָן} as the personal name of a malevolent spirit argue that the absence of the definite article indicates that the idea of \emph{the} \hebrew{שָׂטָן} of Job and Zechariah had evolved into a fully personified Satan by the time of the Chronicler.%
    \footnote{%
        \cite[216--217]{braun1986};
        \cite[107]{coggins1976}. Rollston also finds this reading compelling, though, not without difficulties. See 
        \cite[4--5]{rollston_keith-stuckenbruck2016}.}
Additionally, while the \lxx hails from a later chronological horizon than Chronicles, it is worth noting that the translator used the indefinite substantive \greek{διάβολος} to translate \hebrew{שָׂטָן}---the same term used in Job and Zechariah (also, Ps 108:6) \emph{with} a definite article---which gives some indication that, in the mind of the translator, these passages likely referred to the same entity.% 
    \footnote{Elsewhere the \lxx renders the nominal forms of \hebrew{שָׂטָן} with the feminine \greek{διαβολή} or, in the case of 1~Kgs 11:14, simply in transliteration as \greek{σαταν}. It should be noted, however, that Est 7:4 and 8:1 render the Hebrew √ṣrr as the masculine \greek{διάβολος} as well.} 

 Critics of this view, however, have pointed to the fact that in other cases in the Hebrew Bible, generic nouns that are treated as personal names or titles often \emph{do} retain the definite article.%
    \footnote{\cite[114--117]{japhet2009};
        \cite[370--390]{japhet1993}. Japhet, for example, notes that direct references to the Canaanite deity Baʿal are always accompanied by the definite article. In every instance, the name/title \hebrew{בַּעַל} is made grammatically definite whether by adding the definite article, pronominal suffixes, or being in construct with an explicitly definite noun. 
        \cite[115]{japhet2009} citing 
        \cite[§126d]{gkc}.}
In such a case, \hebrew{שָׂטָן} should simply be understood as an indefinite noun, ``an accuser'' and may be understood as a human antagonist of David.%
    \footnote{See 
        \cite{stokes_jbl2009};
        \cite[114--117]{japhet2009}; 
        \cite[370--390]{japhet1993}.} 
For our purposes, it is not essential that we know for certain how \hebrew{שָׂטָן} was intended to be understood by the \chronicler. What \emph{is} important, however, is that the author of \chronicles plainly understood the mechanisms at work differently than the author of 2~Sam 24. Chief among these differences is the fact that the \chronicler shifts the incitement of the census away from \yahweh and onto a third party. One of the more perplexing aspects of the 2 Sam 24 narrative is that \yahweh seems function as an antagonist to David. It is \yahweh's anger which prompts \yahweh to ``incite'' David to take the census, for which he is punished. At least to modern readers, the resulting narrative appears to be one of a sort of divine ``entrapment'' of David that makes \yahweh seem rather ``mercurial.''%
    \autocite[4]{rollston_keith-stuckenbruck2016}
That \yahweh would incite David to sin then punish him for it was understandably confusing for the \chronicler, and equally confusing is why \yahweh would punish Israel for taking the census to begin with. But within the narrative discourse, there is no hint of confusion. All the characters operate as if \yahweh's response is perfectly reasonable and seem to know the proper actions to take to avert the disaster. Joab, for example, seems reticent about David's request to take the census:
\begin{hebrewtext}
    \versenum{2 Sam 24:3}
    וַיֹּאמֶר יוֹאָב אֶל־הַמֶּלֶךְ וְיוֹסֵף יְהוָה אֱלֹהֶיךָ אֶל־הָעָם כָּהֵם וְכָהֵם מֵאָה פְעָמִים וְעֵינֵי אֲדֹנִי־הַמֶּלֶךְ רֹאוֹת וַאדֹנִי הַמֶּלֶךְ לָמָּה חָפֵץ בַּדָּבָר הַזֶּה׃
\end{hebrewtext}
\begin{translation}
    \versenum{2 Sam 24:3}
    And Joab said to the king, ``May \yahweh your God increase the people a hundred times while the eyes of my lord the king may see (them). But why does my lord the king desire this thing?''
\end{translation}
\noindent
He seems to know that taking the census could be risky. 

What these two insertions reveal is that for the \chronicler, the narrative logic of 2 Samuel did not work within his own set of social frameworks. Instead of reading the \chronicler's attribution of incitement to \hebrew{שָׂטָן} as an attempt at ``absolving'' or explaining away \yahweh's actions because they were offensive to the \chronicler, perhaps it is better to think about the \chronicler attempting to fit the story of 2 Sam 24 into a different theological framework and into a different system of narrative logic. From this perspective, it was not that the \chronicler was scandalized by \yahweh's incitement of David but rather a reflection on the fact those actions lacked a sort of ``theological verisimilitude'' (my term) within the worldview of the \chronicler.%
    \footnote{I suspect that most religious laypeople for whom 2 Sam 24 is scripture, too, would find \yahweh's portrayal in this text out-of-character with the way that God is portrayed elsewhere in their Bibles (not least, in \chronicles!).}
Likewise where the narrative in 2 Sam 24 assumes that the reader understands why Joab would question David about taking the census, the \chronicler supplies the details for Joab's reservations:
\begin{hebrewtext}
    \versenum{1 Chr 21:3}
    וַיֹּאמֶר יוֹאָב יוֹסֵף יְהוָה עַל־עַמּוֹ כָּהֵם מֵאָה פְעָמִים הֲלֹא אֲדֹנִי הַמֶּלֶךְ כֻּלָּם לַאדֹנִי לַעֲבָדִים לָמָּה יְבַקֵּשׁ זֹאת אֲדֹנִי לָמָּה יִהְיֶה לְאַשְׁמָה לְיִשְׂרָאֵל׃
\end{hebrewtext}
\begin{translation}
    \versenum{1 Chr 21:3}
    And Joab said, ``May \yahweh increase his people a hundred times. Are they not all, my lord the king, servants of my lord? Why does my lord seek this? Why shall he bring guilt on Israel?''
\end{translation}
\noindent
Here the \chronicler makes explicit what is implicit in 2 Sam 24---that census taking carries a risk. Although a number of scholars have speculated about what the rationale had been for the original author(s) of 2 Sam 24, the \chronicler infers a plausible rationale from his own theological and ideological frameworks.%
    \footnote{See, especially the discussion in \cite[512--514]{mccarter1984}.}
The same basic tendency to clarify the narrative logic of several apparently inconsistent portions of 2 Sam 24 can be seen throughout the narrative.%   
    \footnote{For example, the angel of \yahweh appears suddenly in the Samuel narrative and seems to be carrying out some violence against the land. The \chronicler introduces the angel as explicitly sent by \yahweh. More than likely there is some kind of textual corruption in the Samuel account, so it is not certain that every additional detail that the \chronicler supplies is original to the \chronicler.}

Perhaps the most significant addition to the \chronicler's account, however, comes at the very end of the story with the identification of Araunah/Ornan's threshing floor with the future site of the Jerusalem temple. In both accounts David is instructed to build an altar to \yahweh and offer sacrifices in an effort to atone for his sin. 



% MAGNETISM BETWEEN SITES
    % Look at the Araunah/Census story of Chr.
        % Cf. with Sam--Kings
        % David and Temple converge (within certain boundaries) 
        % How might external factors affect how this was "remembered"
                % Was Araunah's threshing floor known?
                % What about the imagined role of the king?
                    % David as a cult leader
                    % Why not Solomon?
    % Mt. Moriah is an example of further `magnetism' to another potent site of memory (the Aqedah)



% Within the story of David's census and the threshing floor of Oruna in 1 Chr 21, several mnemonic sites can be understood as exhibiting magnetic qualities. First, although the identity of \hebrew{שָׂטָן} is not clear in the text, later treatments of the story, including in the LXX, treat the character as a malevolent supernatural being. The potency---at least in the interpretation of later periods---of Satan was able to don this particular mischief and take credit for the incitement of David to sin. One might imagine, given \emph{haśśāṭān}'s subordinate position \visavis Yahweh in the prologue to Job, that the two passages were not seen to be in direct conflict with one another, whatever the original intent of the Chronicler might have been. Shifting the incitement of David away from Yahweh can be explained by the ostensible discomfort (or confusion) created by the story in 2 Sam 24, but, supposing \hebrew{שָׂטָן} was imagined by the Chronicler to be a supernatural being, we can account for the Chronicler's choice as an example of magnetism on the part of Satan. 

% Second, the identification of Ornan's threshing floor with the future site of the Solomonic Temple creates an explicit connection between two very potent mnemonic sites: David and the Temple. The discourse surrounding the fact that it was Solomon and not David who constructed the Temple of Yahweh predates even the DtrH, as indicated by 2 Sam 7, but the degree to which David involves himself in making preparations for the construction of the temple in 1 Chr 22:2--29:22 indicates that DtrH did not get the last word on the matter. While 2 Sam 7 provides an apologia for why it was Solomon, and not David, who built the temple, Chronicles takes it a step further by attributing the planning and preparation of the temple's construction to David, leaving only the most nominal tasks for the temple's ``builder,'' Solomon. The inability of David's mnemonic gravitas to fully absorb the temple's construction illustrates the immutability of certain mnemonic sites, particularly those such as buildings and geographic features, despite the relative significance of David for the continued maintenance of Judean identity continued into the \secondtemple Period \visavis Solomon. 

% Finally, after identifying the site of the temple of Solomon with Ornan's threshing floor, and drawing the mnemonic sites of the temple and king David even closer together, the Chronicler includes one additional piece of information to the reader in the description of the temple's construction in 2 Chr 3:1: 

% \begin{quote} \emph{wayyāḥel šəlōmōh liḇnôṯ ʾeṯ-bêṯ-yhwh bı̂rûšālaim bəhar hammôrı̂ā ʾăšer nirʾāh ləḏāwı̂ḏ ʾāḇı̂hû ʾăšer hēḵı̂n bimqôm dāwı̂ḏ bəḡōren ʾornān hayəḇûsı̂} 

% Solomon began to build the temple of Yahweh in Jerusalem \emph{on the mountain of Moriah} where he appeared to David, his father, the place which David designated, on the threshing floor of Ornan, the Jebusite. \end{quote} 

% Although this is the only reference to the \emph{mountain} of Moriah in the Hebrew Bible, the \emph{land} of Moriah is mentioned only in Gen 22, the Aqeda, as the land to which Abraham was to bring Isaac for sacrifice (on a mountain!).\autocite[358--359]{kalimi_htr1990} The reference to Moriah appears to be another example of the magnetic quality of core events in a community's identity. In the same way that David's sacrificial acts at the threshing floor of Ornan---in the memory of the Chronicler---prefigured and made acceptable the offerings made by David there, so too the near-sacrifice of Isaac, by its geographic association with the foundation of the temple in Jerusalem, becomes a prototype for the sacrificial cult.\autocite[In fact, \vermes makes this point explicit and traces the tradition into early Christianity. See][204--211]{vermes1961}
