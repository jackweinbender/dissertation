Chronicles is Rwb
    Not everyone agrees
    I think it checks off enough boxes
BUT, Chronicles does *seem* different, especially for us modern scholars, because it is *in* the Hebrew Bible. up until this point, we have largely sidestepped the problem of textual authority and (later) canonical status. For both GenApoc and (to a lesser degree) Jubilees, it has been easy for (especially modern, western) scholars to corelate the relative authority of these rwb texts with their percieved faithfulness to their putative Vorlagen. In other words, becasue neither GA or Jub became canonical in the Hebrew Bible or the (Western) Christian Old Testament, it is tempting to correlate the inferiority of GA and Jub (and other such texts) with the fact that they are explicitly *derivative.* 

I want to be clear about this line of reasoning. I don't think anyone is making these arguments, but I think this correlation does inform the ways that we tend to treat these texts---they are pseudepigrapha; they are not canon. The fact that they "rewrite" the big traditions the Hebrew Bible does not intersect with or challenge modern notions of canonicity or textual authority. It is okay for GA to rewrite portions of Genesis because the social implication sof ';s.fgb';df.g;'b.dfg

What I'm getting at is that the line of reasoning that goes ``Well, even if some people thouht they were `authoritative,' they weren't canonized, so they couldn't have been that important falls appart when we look at Chronicles. Chronicles forces the issue. It is both a rewriting of Sam-Kings as well as a text which was incorperated into the body of canonical literature of the Hebrew Bible. The *fact* of the plurality of parallel traditions cannot be explained by heirarchies of authority.

Although \chronicles meets the formal criteria of \rwb by almost every measure, it is rarely given more than a passing nod within the scholarly literature on \rwb.%
    \footnote{TODO: Get Refs}
This bracketing of \chronicles as \rwb is, I think, largely a function of the ways that conversations within particular scholarly sub-disciplines often are quite insular and resistant to traversing disciplinary boundaries. In this case, the book of \chronicles falls squarely within the field of ``biblical studies'' and ``Hebrew Bible'' while most of the scholarly work surrounding \rwb falls within the related, but distinct, fields of Early Judaism, Qumran Studies, and Second Temple Studies. Bridging such disciplinary gaps, even when the sub-disciplines are adjacent, can be difficult. Thus, although some commentators on \chronicles note the family resemblance, there is no commentary-length treatment of \chronicles which utilizes \rwb as the primary literary framework for reading \chronicles.

By way of example, Klein's recent commentary on \chronicles (2006) mentions the \rwb only in a footnote, stating:

\begin{quote}
    Perhaps \chronicles could also be compared with the genre called ``rewritten Bible,'' known from Qumran and in the works of Josephus. Such works retell some portion of the Bible while interpreting it through paraphrase, elaboration, allusion to other texts, expansion, conflation, rearrangement, and other techniques. In this case, of course, the ``rewritten Bible'' also became part of the Bible itself.\autocite[17 n.157]{klein2006}
\end{quote}

Setting aside Klein's rather anemic description of \rwb, it is striking---if not terribly surprising---to me that the comparison is not taken more seriously. Instead, Klein characterizes \rwb as a genre ``known from Qumran and ... Josephus'' and not as a phenomenon of Jewish literary production during the \secondtemple period in which \chronicles may also have been participating. Knoppers on the other hand, in his slightly earlier commentary (2003), takes up the issue in a special section of his introduction and offers his thoughts on whether \chronicles is \rwb.\autocite[129--134]{knoppers2003} His conclusions, however, are not much more satisfying. According to Knoppers, \rwb is an interesting angle from which to approach \chronicles, but ultimately, ``\chronicles needs to be understood as its own work.''\autocite[134]{knoppers2003} 

Many of Knoppers' observations are actually quite good. And although, I ultimately disagree with his conclusions about \chronicles \visavis \rwb, the root of this disagreement is only about how to define \rwb. In fact, the objections which Knoppers makes toward characterizing \chronicles as \rwb should sound somewhat familiar to the reader. First, Knoppers notes that the genealogies of 1 Chr 1--9 are not meaningfully ``rewriting'' the Pentateuch in genre or content (though it, in some sense, accounts for the chronology from Adam to David) but rather represents a reworking of earlier material with an incorporation of other traditions know from the Bible and, presumably, a number of the Chronicler's own innovations.%
    \footnote{Throughout this chapter I will refer to the author/editor of Chronicles as ``the Chronicler.'' In doing so, I do not have in mind a particular theory about such a person, or indeed, whether there were multiple ``Chroniclers.'' Nor am I referencing a particular scholarly tradition of including Ezra and Nehemiah within the scope of the work.}
Moreover, the later, more familiar, account of the monarchy of Judah (which closely follows the narratives of Samuel--Kings), according to Knoppers, exhibits some of these same qualities which work against the characterization of \chronicles as \rwb. Although the structure of the narrative portions of Chronicles, in certain ways, closely follows Samuel--Kings, the focus and purpose of the work as a whole is distinct from that of the \DtrH (\dtrh). Knoppers writes:

\begin{quote}
    The Chronicler's account of the monarchy follows the broad outline of Samuel--Kings and borrows extensively from this earlier work. Yet one must ask whether the Chronicler's presentation, with its focus of the Davidides and Judahite history, is a literary embellishment of Samuel--Kings or whether it employs Samuel--Kings, among other sources, to create an alternative story of the monarchy.\dots The Chronicler's depiction of the monarchy is not simply a commentary on the \DtrH\dots He employs the older work as a major source, even as he contests some of its central claims.\autocite[132--33]{knoppers2003}
\end{quote}
\noindent
Thus, Knoppers sees the work of the Chronicler as something not restricted to commentary or literary embellishment upon an earlier text. The purpose of Chronicles, in other words, does not have anything to do with explaining or ``fixing'' Samuel--Kings (indeed, Chronicles complicates the issue more often than not), rather, it is its own work of literature working toward its own purposes.

Of course, Knoppers' point about Chronicles is essentially the point that I have been arguing for \visavis \rwb---that although there are interpretive elements within these texts, they cannot be reduced to ``narrative commentaries'' and need not be thought of as primarily ``exegetical'' works.

Scholars of the Hebrew Bible have long observed that the book of \chronicles is a derivative work of Samuel--Kings reflecting the concerns and religious sensibilities of the late Persian or Early Hellenistic Periods. For example, in his classic work on the history of ancient Israel, Julius Wellhausen begins his treatment of the history of traditions within Judaism with a lengthy discussion of the book of \chronicles. In his treatment of the book, Wellhausen argues that the history of Israel as portrayed in \chronicles differs from that portrayed in Samuel--Kings due to the chronological distance of the works and the intervention of the Priestly Code into the theology of \secondtemple Judaism.%
    \footnote{%
        \cite[171--172]{wellhausen1957}. See also
        \cite{wright_ulrich-wright1992}.}
\chronicles, according to Wellhausen, provides a clear example of the way that ancient Israel's traditions evolved over time. Just as the legal material of the Hexateuch developed over the centuries, so too the traditions of the historical books were subject to the changing theologies of later centuries. While the particulars of the relationship of Samuel--Kings to \chronicles and the nuances of priestly influences on the Hebrew Bible remain subject to scholarly debate, the broad consensus remains that 1) \chronicles was written sometime in the late Persian or early Hellenistic periods, 2) it heavily utilized Samuel--Kings as a literary source, and 3) it bears an ideological \emph{Tendenz} influenced by (though not identical to) the final layers of the Pentateuch.%
    \footnote{For a thorough and reasonably recent summary of the \emph{status quaestionis}, see

        \cite{japhet2009};
        \cite{braun1986} and
        \cite{coggins1976}.}
 The scholarly discourse surrounding the formation of the Hebrew Bible has increasingly turned to memory studies as a robust framework for describing the processes by which the biblical traditions were produced and transmitted.%
    \footnote{%
        \cite{wright2014};
        \cite{blenkinsopp2013};
        \cite{rogerson2010};
        \cite{davies2008};
        \cite{hendel2005};
        \cite{smith_cbq2002}.}
Wellhausen chose to begin his treatment of the history of traditions with \chronicles because of the relative security with which scholars are able to date Samuel--Kings and the major Pentateuchal strata \visavis \chronicles. For the very same reason, \chronicles likewise has played an important role in early applications of memory theory within biblical studies.%
    \footnote{%
        \cite{benzvi_st2017};
        \cite{benzvi-a_evans-williams2013};
        \cite{benzvi-b_evans-williams2013}.}
While \chronicles is not the \emph{latest} book in the Hebrew Bible, it is uniquely situated at the end of the traditioning process preserved in the Hebrew Bible. In some ways, therefore, \chronicles gets the last word on a certain set of traditions surrounding the monarchic period, in particular those of David, Solomon, and the kings of Judah. 

Although it is broadly agreed upon that \chronicles exhibits a hypertextual relationship to Samuel--Kings, treating \chronicles as an exemplar of Rewritten Bible (\rwb) is somewhat less common.%
    \footnote{Though, not particularly \emph{un}common. See 
        \cite{campbell_zsengeller2014};
        \cite{zahn_lim-collins2010};
        \cite{bernstein_textus2005}.
        Alexander considers \chronicles to be a ``prototype'' of \rwb, see, 
        \cite[100]{alexander_carson-williamson1988}.
        I have adopted the terminology of hyper-/hypotext from Genette. In this case, to say that \chronicles is a ``hypertext'' of Samuel--Kings is to say that it is derivative, but not a commentary on Samuel--Kings. See
        \cite[5]{genette1997}.}
The ambivalence of scholars towards treating \chronicles as \rwb is rooted, unsurprisingly, in the confusion surrounding the definition of the term. Knoppers, for example, takes special care to treat the question of whether \chronicles should be understood as \rwb in the introduction of his commentary and notes, from the very beginning, that he will answer the question based on what he understands to be the essential elements of \rwb.\autocite[129--134]{knoppers2003} He writes: 

 \begin{quote}
    They [\rwb] select from, interpret, comment on, and expand portions of a particular biblical book (or group of books), addressing obscurities, contradictions, and other perceived problems with the source text. Rewritten Bible texts normally emulate the form of the source text and follow it sequentially. The major intention of such works seems to be to provide a coherent interpretive reading of the biblical text.\autocite[130]{knoppers2003}
\end{quote} 

Knoppers observes that, while \chronicles exhibits most of the specific literary moves which \rwb is known for (expanding, harmonizing, and augmenting its \emph{Vorlage}), the presence of material which is entirely unique to \chronicles cannot be attributed to a purely exegetical or explanatory impulse. In addition to the narrative additions within \chronicles, the genealogies of 1 Chr 1--9 have no corollary in Samuel--Kings, and can hardly be considered a rewritten form of the Pentateuch.\autocite[132]{knoppers2003} Thus, while Knoppers affirms that certain portions of \chronicles ``may be profitably compared with a number of rewritten Bible texts,''\autocite[131]{knoppers2003} ultimately he concludes that \chronicles ``is more than a paraphrase or literary elaboration of the primary history''\autocite[134]{knoppers2003} and thus \rwb cannot can account for \chronicles as a whole, instead suggesting that it should be treated as its own work.\autocite[131--134]{knoppers2003} 

While Knoppers's assessment is fair given the definition that he supplies for \rwb, in the preceding chapters of this dissertation, I have argued that similar extra-exegetical qualities exist within the \rwb corpus which push us to consider the function of \rwb as more than a method for explaining sacred texts. The rationale for why \rwb cannot account for the complexity of the whole book of \chronicles, according to Knoppers, is the same basic argument that I have made for why an \emph{exegetically} focused definition of \rwb is insufficient to account for the complexity of even the literature that scholars \emph{traditionally} consider to be \rwb. In other words, Knoppers's argument for why \chronicles should not be considered \rwb is the same essential argument that I am making for \ga and \jub. The same case could just as easily be applied to Josephus's \ant, the \templescroll, and others. The difference between my thesis and Knoppers, however, is that where he sees disjunction between \rwb and \chronicles, I am arguing that all of these texts represent the same fundamental social and cultural processes of memory and that memory theory offers a degree of abstraction for talking about these processes which highlights their similarities.
