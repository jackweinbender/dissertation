This chapter is meant to bring together the discussions of RwB and Memory studies by talking about Chroniclesâ€”it has both been treated extensively from the perspective of Memory and is widely touted as an example of RwB. However, the move to talk about other RwB texts as Memory has not, generally, occurred.

This chapter is to begin to illustrate how memory studies "works" currently in the field. This is meant to be a fairly run-of-the-mill chapter which illustrates some of the key ideas that are important for the study.

This is where I will be making explicit connections methodologically to the theorists like Halbwachs, Assmann, and Schwartz.

I will focus on; Reception, reformulation, and construction

    The purpose of Chronicles is not to "explain" Sam--Kings. Although it's been called midrash, etc., the history of scholarship of Chroncles has "decided" that it is something different with its own goals. Memory theory has been very successfully applied to Chronicles. There was a socal function to the book of Chronicles. It drew upon traditions about Israel, it's ancestors, and its kings and religious institutions not simply to explain its sacred texts, but to reshape how that percieved past was understood for the purpose of informing the present circumstances of its readers.
