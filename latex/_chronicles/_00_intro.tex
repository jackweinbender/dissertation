\section{Introduction}
TODO: Write me.
% This chapter is meant to bring together the discussions of RwB and Memory studies by talking about Chroniclesâ€”it has both been treated extensively from the perspective of Memory and is widely touted as an example of RwB. However, the move to talk about other RwB texts as Memory has not, generally, occurred.

% This chapter is to begin to illustrate how memory studies "works" currently in the field. This is meant to be a fairly run-of-the-mill chapter which illustrates some of the key ideas that are important for the study.

% This is where I will be making explicit connections methodologically to the theorists like Halbwachs, Assmann, and Schwartz.

% What are we doing? We are historcizing processes of memory.
