\section{Magnetism and Convergence of Mnemonic Sites}
% Convergence and Magnetism between Sites of Memory
Although both David and the Temple maybe thought of as discrete sites of memory, it is important to remember that they participate in a \emph{network} of symbolic social meaning. Thus, ``discrete'' here does not mean ``isolated.'' Moreover, not all sites of memory carry the same weight of significance within a particular symbolic system. In other words, not all sites of memory are created equal; David is a much more prominent and potent node within the social memory of ancient Israel than was Shimei, his critic. Though they participate within the same discursive space---even in the Bible---David is a more significant symbol. Likewise the Temple's symbolic significance far outweighs that of the \translit{bāmôt}, despite the fact that---functionally---their social function was similar.

But, what do we mean by ``significance''? One way to think about a symbol's significance within a social space is by considering not the ``size'' of the node (whatever that might mean), but by how ``connected'' the node is within the social network. More highly-connected sites of memory---those which for one reason or another have been connected to many other such sites within the social memory---may be viewed as more ``significant,'' while sites with fewer connections are comparatively less significant with respect to social and cultural memory.%
    \footnote{Of course, when I say that a king is more ``significant'' than, say, a peasant, I am making an assessment of the social impact of the individual on the society broadly and not making a judgment of the intrinsic value or importance of the individual. Moreover, I am not saying that such significance ought to guide the historian. This is merely meant as a description of this particular social phenomenon.}


    % MAGNETISM OF SPECIFIC SITES: 
        % Give basic examples for:
            % David (Goliath?)
            % Temple (Creation?)
    % MAGNETISM BETWEEN SITES
        % Look at the Araunah/Census story of Chr.
            % Cf. with Sam--Kings
            % David and Temple converge (within certain boundaries) 
            % How might external factors affect how this was "remembered"
                    % Was Araunah's threshing floor known?
                    % What about the imagined role of the king?
                        % David as a cult leader
                        % Why not Solomon?
        % Mt. Moriah is an example of further `magnetism' to another potent site of memory (the Aqedah)
