7. Conclusion
    <!-- The purpose of Chronicles is not to "explain" Sam--Kings. -->
    Although it's been called midrash, etc., the history of scholarship of Chronicles has "decided" that it is something different with its own goals. Memory theory has been very successfully applied to Chronicles. There was a social function to the book of Chronicles. It drew upon traditions about Israel, it's ancestors, and its kings and religious institutions not simply to explain its sacred texts, but to reshape how that perceived past was understood for the purpose of informing the present circumstances of its readers.
