    \versenum{50:5}
    VanderKam: The jubilees will pass by until Israel is pure of every sexual evil, impurity, contamination, sin, and error. Then they will live confidently in the entire land. they will no longer have any satan or any evil person. The land will be pure from that time until eternity.

    \emph{**VanderKam's translation (in the interest of time). I will provide my own text and translation in subsequent drafts}
