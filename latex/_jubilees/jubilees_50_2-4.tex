\begin{translation}
    \versenum{50:2}
    VanderKam: On Mt. Sinai I told you about the sabbaths of the land and the years of jubilees in the sabbaths of the years, but its year we have not told you until the time when you enter the land which you will possess.
    \versenum{3}
    the land will observe its sabbaths when they live on it, and they are to know the year of the jubilee.
    \versenum{4}
    For this reason I have arranged for you the weeks of years and the jubilees---49 jubilees from the time of Adam until today, and one week and two years. I is still 40 years off (for learning the Lord's commandments) until the time when he leads (them) across to the land of Canaan, after they have crossed the Jordan to the west of it.
